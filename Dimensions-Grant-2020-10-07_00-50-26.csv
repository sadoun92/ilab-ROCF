3,grant.9342422,EP/T022574/1,Future Places: A Digital Economy Centre on Understanding Place Through Pervasive Computing,Future Places: A Digital Economy Centre on Understanding Place Through Pervasive Computing,"The Future Places Centre will explore how ubiquitous and pervasive technologies, the IoT, and new data science tools can let people reimagine what their future spaces might be. Today, the footprint of such systems extends well beyond the work environments where they first showed themselves and are now, quite literally, ubiquitous. Combined with advances in data science, particularly in the general area of AI, these are enabling entirely new forms of applications and expanding our understanding of how we can shape our physical spaces. The result of these trends is that the potential impact of these systems is no longer confined to work settings or the scientific imagination; it points towards all contexts in which the relationship between space and human practice might be altered through digitally-enabled comprehension of the worlds we inhabit. 

Such change necessitates enriching the public imagination about what future places might be and how they might be understood. In particular, it points towards new ways of using pervasive technologies (such as the IoT), to shape healthy, sustainable living through the creation of appropriate places. To paraphrase Churchill: if he said we make our buildings, and our buildings come to shape us, the Future Places centre starts from the premise that new understanding of places (enabled by pervasive computing, data science and AI tools), can be combined with a public concern for sustainability and the environment to help shape healthier places and thus make healthier people. 

It is thus the goal of the centre to reimagine and develop further Mark Weiser's original vision of ubiquitous computing. As it does this so it will cohere Lancaster's pioneering DE projects and create a world-class interdisciplinary research endeavour that binds Lancaster to the local community, to industry and government, making the North West a test-bed for what might be.","The Future Places Centre will explore how ubiquitous and pervasive technologies, the IoT, and new data science tools can let people reimagine what their future spaces might be.

2,grant.9304052,NPRP12S-0227-190166,Lithium Recovery from Reverse Osmosis Brine Using Solar-Powered Membrane Distillation-Electrochemical Capturing Hybrid System,Lithium Recovery from Reverse Osmosis Brine Using Solar-Powered Membrane Distillation-Electrochemical Capturing Hybrid System,"Seawater desalination is one of the most important means of securing water in countries that lack water resources. Middle-East countries, including Qatar, have installed many thermo-based seawater desalination plants using power and hot steam generated from gas or oil-based power plants. In recent years, Qatar has produced about more than 36 million gallons of desalinated water daily through membrane-based seawater desalination using reverse osmosis (RO) technology. However, this seawater desalination method requires additional post-treatment for brine, which is about twice the salt concentration of seawater. On the other hand, the high salinity of brine can provide a good opportunity to recover rare elements such as lithium, uranium, or strontium in seawater. Thus, RO brine will be a pivotal opportunity to be recognized as a resource repository to recover various resources while being treated to protect the ecosystem.      

This project selects lithium ion among the resource recovery materials in the RO brine due to the rapid consumption and depletion of lithium worldwide. Currently, seawater evaporation in a pond is used as one of the conventional methods for recovering lithium, where the concentrated salts by evaporation are treated with a Lime-Soda precipitation method to recover lithium while removing other co-ions (Ca, Mg, etc.) selectively with carbonate precipitates. However, this method requires vast land, can cause environmental problems, and the extraction rate of lithium is very slow. Therefore, it is an urgent task to develop an innovative technology capable of rapidly concentrating brine, thereby recovering lithium with high selectivity and high purity to meet the demand for lithium supply.

This project proposes the state-of-the-art flow-through electrochemical Li recovery (FT-EliR) process, in which Li metal oxide compounds (LiMOCs) (LiAlO2 or Li2MnO3) and carbon-based hybrid capacitive materials will be used as the Li-capturing electrode and the counter ion-capturing counter electrode, respectively. Here, the FT-EliR system will use RO brine as a resource recovery solution to recover lithium. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) will be employed to rapidly further concentrate the RO brine to provide a more concentrated lithium solution to the FT-EliR system. The application of DCMD technology to further concentrate the RO brine will provide a technology platform for the recovery of very low concentrations of precious elements in seawater. The DCMD system will consist of a hydrophobic membrane and a three dimensional (3D)-printing spacer with a significant flux and a low fouling tendency to concentrate the RO brine at salinity 3-5 times higher than seawater. Herein, RO brine must be heated up to near 80oC to provide the brine as feed water for the MD process. Heating RO brine will be accomplished by a concentrated solar power (CSP) system in which the condensed high-temperature solar energy will raise the temperature of RO brine used as cooling water and at the same time generates power through an internally installed thermoelectric (TE) module. The power generated in the CSP system will be used to operate the subsequent DCMD and electrochemical lithium recovery (EliR) systems. Eventually, the sequential CSP/DCMD/FT-EliR hybrid process will recover lithium continuously from RO brine much faster than conventional methods. 

This study aims to demonstrate the successful recovery of lithium from the actual RO brine by applying the proposed hybrid process to Qatarâ  s Umm Al Houl Power and Desalination Plant at the last Work Package (WP) of the project. Following the bilateral agreement between Qatar Electricity & Water Company (QEWC) and Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) of Qatar University (QU) in 2018, this project is one of CAMâ  s commitments to develop water technologies related to the operation and management of seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant in order to create economic added value to Qatarâ  s desalination technology.

The final goals of this proposed project will be achieved by performing seven Work Packages (WPs): (1) Project management and steering, (2) Preparing analytical experiment procedures and project safety plan, (3) Develop/optimize concentrated solar power (CSP) system for heating RO brine and producing electricity, (4) Design/optimize direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) system to further concentrate RO brine, (5) Develop/optimize electrochemical lithium recovery (EliR) system, (6) Construct/optimize a CSP/DCMD/FT-EliR hybrid process for continuous lithium recovery from RO brine, (7) Develop knowledge and problem-solving capacities for researchers and students in Qatar.","Seawater desalination is one of the most important means of securing water in countries that lack water resources. Middle-East countries, including Qatar, have installed many thermo-based seawater desalination plants using power and hot steam generated from gas or oil-based power plants. In recent years, Qatar has produced about more than 36 million gallons of desalinated water daily through membrane-based seawater desalination using reverse osmosis (RO) technology. However, this seawater desalination method requires additional post-treatment for brine, which is about twice the salt concentration of seawater. On the other hand, the high salinity of brine can provide a good opportunity to recover rare elements such as lithium, uranium, or strontium in seawater. Thus, RO brine will be a pivotal opportunity to be recognized as a resource repository to recover various resources while being treated to protect the ecosystem.      

This project selects lithium ion among the resource recovery materials in the RO brine due to the rapid consumption and depletion of lithium worldwide. Currently, seawater evaporation in a pond is used as one of the conventional methods for recovering lithium, where the concentrated salts by evaporation are treated with a Lime-Soda precipitation method to recover lithium while removing other co-ions (Ca, Mg, etc.) selectively with carbonate precipitates. However, this method requires vast land, can cause environmental problems, and the extraction rate of lithium is very slow. Therefore, it is an urgent task to develop an innovative technology capable of rapidly concentrating brine, thereby recovering lithium with high selectivity and high purity to meet the demand for lithium supply.

This project proposes the state-of-the-art flow-through electrochemical Li recovery (FT-EliR) process, in which Li metal oxide compounds (LiMOCs) (LiAlO2 or Li2MnO3) and carbon-based hybrid capacitive materials will be used as the Li-capturing electrode and the counter ion-capturing counter electrode, respectively. Here, the FT-EliR system will use RO brine as a resource recovery solution to recover lithium. Direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) will be employed to rapidly further concentrate the RO brine to provide a more concentrated lithium solution to the FT-EliR system. The application of DCMD technology to further concentrate the RO brine will provide a technology platform for the recovery of very low concentrations of precious elements in seawater. The DCMD system will consist of a hydrophobic membrane and a three dimensional (3D)-printing spacer with a significant flux and a low fouling tendency to concentrate the RO brine at salinity 3-5 times higher than seawater. Herein, RO brine must be heated up to near 80oC to provide the brine as feed water for the MD process. Heating RO brine will be accomplished by a concentrated solar power (CSP) system in which the condensed high-temperature solar energy will raise the temperature of RO brine used as cooling water and at the same time generates power through an internally installed thermoelectric (TE) module. The power generated in the CSP system will be used to operate the subsequent DCMD and electrochemical lithium recovery (EliR) systems. Eventually, the sequential CSP/DCMD/FT-EliR hybrid process will recover lithium continuously from RO brine much faster than conventional methods.

3,grant.8557588,187933,A Dynamic Multiple Discrete Continuous Choice Model,A Dynamic Multiple Discrete Continuous Choice Model,"Multiple discrete choices are rather common in consumer decisions. For instance, consumers may undertake several activities within a leisure day or purchase different products while shopping. Along with multiple discrete decisions, consumers typically also decide how much of the chosen products to consume (e.g. the time allocated to various activities or the amount of money spent on different products). These situations have come to be labelled multiple discrete continuous (MDC) choices.In the last decade, the discrete choice literature has made significant advances in developing empirical frameworks to better understand individual MDC decisions. For example, Bhat (2005, 2008) formulates the multiple discrete continuous extreme value (MDCEV) model based on a microeconomic utility maximization formulation that can accommodate situations where consumers may select either only one product (goods are perfect substitutes) or multiple products (goods are imperfect substitutes) due to diminishing marginal utility.Most MDC empirical frameworks derived thus far, including the one formulated by Bhat (2005, 2008), are static models and do not account for the fact that people often make decisions based on their expectations about the future. That is, these models do not capture the forward-looking behavior of consumers (see Cirillo and Xu, 2011).  Schiraldi (2011) and Cirillo, Xu and Bastin (2015) propose a dynamic discrete choice (DDC) framework in which decision-makers are forward-looking and expected inter-temporal payoff is maximized. Nevertheless, decision-makers are assumed to select a single discrete alternative from a set of available and mutual exclusive alternatives (i.e. goods are perfect substitutes) at each time t, thus leaving multiple discrete choices out of the picture. Glerum, Frejinger, Karlostrom, Hugosson and Bierlaire (2013) extend the dynamic discrete choice framework by developing a dynamic discrete continuous choice model to evaluate car ownership and usage, albeit without allowing for diminishing marginal utility and assuming at most two discrete choice alternative at each time t.The aim of my research project is to develop a dynamic multiple discrete continuous (DMDC) choice model that can potentially (a) accommodate intertemporal substitution effects and (b) allow alternatives and their attributes to change over the course of a finite temporal horizon. This empirical framework embeds multiple discrete continuous decisions into a dynamic programming approach. Model formulations, estimation techniques, and empirical findings from the proposed study will be disseminated at conferences and as journal papers.","Multiple discrete choices are rather common in consumer decisions.

There is however a 'nugget-of-hope', should corals be able to establish symbioses with more thermally-resistant algae. For this to happen, though, corals and potential algal symbionts must communicate with each other to form an integrated, functional unit, yet we know little about the molecular signals involved. Here, our world-class team will address this major knowledge-gap. In particular, we will focus on three classes of signal molecules - eicosanoids, inositols and volatiles - that play widespread roles as ‘building blocks’ of cellular language. We will confirm the presence and cellular location of these signal molecules, before elucidating their roles in the successful establishment of the symbiosis. By employing a suite of powerful 'omics' technologies, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and volatilomics, we will build on our previous Marsden-funded research to unravel the complexities of this inter-kingdom communication to a degree that has not been possible before.","Coral reefs may not survive this century, in large part due to bleaching where corals lose their symbiotic algae in response to warming.

3,grant.9015474,19-UOA-346,"Topological algebra, first-order logic, and computability","Topological algebra, first-order logic, and computability","We apply first-order logic and algorithmic methods to mathematical structures.  A fascinating question is whether an infinite mathematical object (such as a group) has a finite description, in particular when the description is a sentence in first-order logic. This usually means that the object's structure is far from random, and well understood. We address this question in the setting of topological algebra. (This raises the question whether the  algebraic structure determines the continuous structure.) We apply computability theoretic ideas to mathematical structures in two ways. On the one hand we ask how hard it is to see that two concrete presentations abstractly determine the same object; in particular we consider symmetry groups. On the other hand we use algorithmic tools to develop a notion of   randomness for elements of mathematical structures that  can be thought of as infinite sequences of quantum bits.  
             Computability theory and  first-order languages are connected in many ways.   Gödel's 1931 incompleteness theorem indirectly used computable functions to show that some true first-order sentence in arithmetic is unprovable. Tarski (1953) studied incomputable first-order theories. The project makes several such connections; e.g. we investigate the computational complexity of groups that satisfy the sentences true in all finite groups.","We apply first-order logic and algorithmic methods to mathematical structures.

The core problem that is addressed in the research proposal Qatar Robotic Printing [QRP] using local resources is the actual inefficiency and insustainability of design, structural optimization, materialization, building methods, assembly and climatic operation of commercial and residential buildings of today. The majority of realized homes, offices and institutional buildings are typically unsustainable in their outdated design to production methods. The QRP research will prove - by building prototypes and full scale parts of a building - that 3D printing using local resources will offer a highly competitive, efficient and sustainable alternative. In international labs, and in private companies as well, prominent research is being performed with respect to 3D printing, based on a variety of materials ranging from plastics to concrete and steel. Most of this research however is small scale and difficult to scale up to the size of multi-story commercial and cultural buildings. Currently not enough effort is being done at R&D levels - neither in the academic world, nor in the contracting AEC firms - on how to digitally design, produce and assemble structurally optimized building components into larger built sustainable structures.
This QRP research aims at scaling up the 3D printing technology to the level of complete villas and buildings, to be based on a number of scheduled innovations in the field of: 1) lean parametric design to production processes, saving money time and resources, 2) improved material properties based on locally available and re-used materials to feed the 3d printing robots, 3) the smart integration of cultural-aesthetic, structural and climatic performance in the 3d printed building components, and 4) the assembly of prefabricated integrated 3d printed elements into large scale building complexes, by applying state-of-the-art principles of mass customization. 3D Printing for the Qatar market. The Qatar market requires the building of 300 new homes for Qatari residents, of which we believe that 20% should and could be 3d printed by 2030. The 3d printing manufacturing of the Qatari homes will deliver not only the shell and core structure, but also its indoor and outdoor finishings in one integrated process. By developing fully integrated building components, merging the necessary insulation and natural ventilation as to perform a sustainable low-energy operation, no more onsite wet finishing and / or inefficient improvisations will be necessary. All design and building issues are resolved in the lean parametric design procedures before starting the 3d printing manufacturing of the integrated building components. Parametric design in combination with 3d printing allows each building component to have an unique structure and unique customized finishing pattern, therewith bringing back the visual and tectonic qualities of expert handicraft of earlier days. Thanks to the lean parametric design to robotic production each house, both structurally and in its finishings, can be customized to the individual wishes of the owner without extra costs. The 3D printing additive manufacturing process deposits only materials where and as needed. Impact on the diversification and resilience of the Qatar economy. The expected impact of this 3 years research project will mean a substantial increase in efficiency, intelligence, sustainability performance and aesthetic value of the design process, the production process and the assembly methods of built structures. It is predicted to  lead to better performing buildings at no extra costs, and to healthier and visually enriched environments for people to work and to live in. The QRP research provides for an inventive combination of materials, process industries, business models and links to public-private partnerships in delivering products to markets and customers. QRP will develop a new mix for 3d concrete printing of large scale building components using local limestone, and a new mix using the rubber of discarded car tires for 3d printing of flexible building components. The QRP research will inevitably lead to a diversification of the economy of Qatar in the advanced technology industry, replacing low-wage workers engaging highly skilled in Qatar educated designers, programmers, technicians and entrepreneurs as to act and thrive in the knowledge-based economy of the 4th Industrial Revolution. The QRP research will thus be instrumental in diversifying and developing Qatarâ  s industry and services towards a knowledge-based economy, by designing, prototyping of innovative integrated building components and by real world applications. Use of local materials and re-use of discarded materials. In collaboration with the Center of Advanced Materials of the Qatar University the QRP research team will develop computational material design strategies based on the exploitation of local materials and the re-use of discarded materials to facilitate innovative large scale additive manufacturing processes, based on lean parametric design to production methods. Collaborating with and between robots. QRP research will use object recognition and detection software / hardware as to allow the 3d printing robots to perform useful tasks in unstructured, dynamic environments such as the production factory and the building site. The QRP team will consider robots collaborating with other robots and interact with humans to fulfill their complex building tasks. The establishment of onsite field factories employing a swarm of customized robots to execute specialized tasks will form part of the QRP research vision as to demonstrate in what direction the factory of the future will develop. Partnerships with industry and academia.

We are exploiting the potential of “worm therapy” by mimicking the beneficial effects of parasite worm infection, which regulates the immune system to prevent inflammation. We have analysed the molecules secreted by a parasite, and, among these, we have identified a single novel protein, which prevents type 1 diabetes in a mouse model. This successful outcome is attributable to this molecule’s ability to prevent inflammation and enhance beta cell survival, and represents the first time that a single molecule has been shown to possess these important dual effects. Accordingly, this offers great potential for the development of therapeutic interventions.  

Here, we will determine the mechanisms by which this unique molecule supports the survival of beta cells in a mouse model of disease. To demonstrate its potential clinical translation, we will investigate whether the parasite molecule mediates the same positive outcome on human beta cells. Success with these analyses would strongly support developing this molecule as a therapeutic, not only as a treatment for type 1 diabetes, but also as a mechanism to enhance beta cell survival during the preparation of islets for transplantation.","The only strategy that will delay, prevent, and ultimately cure type 1 diabetes is a combination of immune regulation and enhanced beta cell survival.

However, currently there is a major gap between public perception of humanoid / social robot capabilities and their actual capabilities. The cognitive and social capabilities of the current humanoid robots are still very limited.

Although social robotics is an inherently multi-disciplinary field, there are no systematic efforts to develop novel sensing, perception and understanding capabilities for these robots grounded in the state of the art in the fields of affective computing, social signal processing, computer vision and machine learning. To avoid re-inventing the wheel, researchers in HRI often and rightly utilise available sensing / perception tools from other domains, creating their own in-house datasets and evaluations. However, these practices hinder advance in social robotics, leading to a major lack of novel and domain specific tools, and a lack of measures for benchmarking due to a lack of annotated, publicly available multimodal interaction datasets that are vital for comparative evaluation. 

This Fellowship aims to address these major gaps in HRI and social robotics. Its vision is to:

(1) equip humanoid robots with novel socio-emotional intelligence and adaptation capabilities grounded in the state of the art in affective computing, social signal processing, computer vision and machine learning fields; 

(2) investigate the deployment of humanoid robots as socio-emotionally smart embodied personal devices that can potentially revolutionise our ability to maintain healthier behaviours and working environments, leading to resilient communities.","Social robots are envisioned to interact closely with people safely and efficiently, and to add value to people's lives by helping, caring, teaching and entertaining. However, currently there is a major gap between public perception of humanoid / social robot capabilities and their actual capabilities.

MARL is a relatively recent concept in machine learning that are being actively investigated by a number of research teams including those at Facebook AI Research and Microsoft Research. Some of the MARL applications have transitioned to the practical domains such as cyberattack countermeasures and robot control. There is a possibility that MARL frameworks will be able to address the distributed, cooperative, or hierarchical control problems in heterogeneous teams such as autonomous agent swarms and human-machine teams. However, in order to address such problems, MARL has to be able to first learn to deal with the difference in autonomy level, response time, and learning rate among the team members.

2,grant.7922137,182813,Seeking Birdscapes: Contemporary Listening and Recording Practices in Ornithology and Environmental Sound Art,Seeking Birdscapes: Contemporary Listening and Recording Practices in Ornithology and Environmental Sound Art,"Since Schafer’s pioneering The Tuning of the World (1977), research on sonic environments has proliferated in both the humanities and the life sciences, putting the human ear in ever wider cultural, social, and technological contexts by exploring specific sound spaces and auditory practices. Rooted in soundscape and sensory studies, “Seeking Birdscapes” is a novel approach to explore how people relate to acoustic properties of environments. It aims to gain new insights into human-nature relations by focusing on the auditory, sonic, and musical dimensions of people’s engagement with their physical surroundings in which birds, because of their pronounced vocality, play a significant role.Because sound itself has no inherent meaning, people’s conceptualizations of sound (and ultimately music) may differ quite drastically, even if they have been socialized in the same world. We assume that people listen differently to nature sounds such as bird vocalizations, depending on their training (e.g., ornithologists and musicians) as well as their personal biographies. Furthermore, we assume that people's attunement to sonic ecosystems depends on geographical factors. There are numerous studies within one ecosystem (e.g., Amazon or Arctic Siberia), but no comparison of two vastly different geographic settings, such as the densely populated Europe and the vast Australian bush.A pilot study on auditory experience we conducted at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts suggests that insightful data can be gathered by interviewing skilled listeners. The proposed project, thus, will focus on a selected sample of expert listeners: field ornithologists and environmental sound artists. We will reexamine questions regarding the dialogue between listeners and their sonic physical surroundings (soundscapes): How do they experience the sonic nature that surrounds them? What modes of listening are applied? What kind of ideas do they have about the environment? What feelings are triggered while listening to bird and nature sounds? How do audio technologies such as recording shape the experience in and outside the field? Conversely, how do sonic experiences shape biographies and an environmental consciousness? Our focus on an experiential hearing perspective calls for a methodology that involves participant observation, autoethnography, and episodical interviews based on Grounded Theory.Through our collaborative approach across disciplinary boundaries, such as our cooperation with the Swiss Ornithological Institute in Sempach and the Foundation BirdLife Lucerne, the project also aims for a broader impact on society. Our research will contribute to current ecological concerns regarding humans’ impact on nature by focusing on the sonic dimension of our physical surroundings. The production of a mobile “Birdscape Listening Room,” based on our research findings and in collaboration with the Natural History Museum of Lucerne, will raise awareness among the public at large about the characteristic soundscapes that surround us as part of our intangible heritage.","Since Schafer’s pioneering The Tuning of the World (1977), research on sonic environments has proliferated in both the humanities and the life sciences, putting the human ear in ever wider cultural, social, and technological contexts by exploring specific sound spaces and auditory practices.

As a global Consortium composed of eight European and nine non-European partners, we seek to (1) to identify, evaluate, compare and share practices in five major local government areas (local responsibilities, local finances, local government structure, intergovernmental relations and people’s participation); (2) to encourage the effective application of the best-fit practices by local governments; (3) to strengthen international and intersectoral collaborative research; (4) to enhance the career perspectives of the staff involved by increasing their mobility both within the academic and the non-academic sectors and between these sectors.
LoGov’s methodological approach relies on a comprehensive comparative analysis that draws on findings from 15 countries or wider regions on six continents, the extensive involvement of local policy-makers through local government associations and a multi- and interdisciplinary approach that is facilitated by the Consortium’s expertise in four disciplines (public law, political science, public administration and economics).
The training strategy of LoGov is based on both secondment-related and network-wide activities. The strategy combines well-established events with newly developed transferable and research skills training, including open science, communication and research transfer training.
To achieve the maximum impact, LoGov’s dissemination strategy targets both the wider scientific community and local policy-makers. It does so when sharing the key training result of widening career perspectives and the main research result of providing best-fit practices for local governments. These contribute to making them more resilient in light of changing urban-rural relations, a primary societal challenge of our times.","LoGov aims to form an international and intersectoral training and research network in order to provide best-fit practices for local governments to address the changing urban-rural interplay and manage its impacts.

Our focus is on breathlessness that persists despite optimal treatment of the underlying condition. This widespread and frightening symptom has a major detrimental impact on patients’ quality of life and distresses their family, friends and carers. It is associated with physical and psychosocial morbidity and results in high use of health care services, including emergency care.

There are no licenced medicines for CB in the world. It is a major challenge to clinical management, care quality and patient wellbeing. We have completed a feasibility trial in 60 patients, reviews and case studies that suggest mirtazapine is a promising treatment.  

To assess if mirtazapine is effective, we conduct a randomised double blind clinical trial of mirtazapine versus placebo in patients with CB and COPD or ILD. The trial recruits 324 patients over 18 months across respiratory, palliative care and community services in Poland, Ireland, Italy, Germany and the UK. We study the effects of treatment over time on patients, their family or caregivers and care costs. We survey clinicians and produce accessible European guidance on treating CB. 

The consortium unites a unique multi-disciplinary group of clinician scientists from respiratory, palliative, geriatric and rehabilitation fields, alongside statisticians, trialists, health economists, health care researchers, patient and consumer groups and a European Society.  This ensures the optimal design and operation of the trial and the widest impact from its results.

3,grant.7611641,EP/R035814/1,"Equations in groups, formal languages and complexity","Equations in groups, formal languages and complexity","Solving equations has always been a central question for mathematics. Whether searching for the roots of a polynomial or solving a differential equation, finding or approximating the solutions is an essential part of science, from pure to applied, and understanding the properties of the solutions opens up worlds of algebraic, dynamical, geometric or logical structure. 
 
This project centres on finding and understanding the solutions of equations in infinite nonabelian discrete groups, a topic at the wild frontier between solvable and unsolvable, with far-reaching applications to algebra, logic, geometry and theoretical computer science. Understanding solutions is crucial in order to expand algebraic geometry to a non-commutative setting, to master the first order theory of a structure, to determine isomorphism between two hyperbolic groups, to advance unification theory, and to answer questions about combinatorics on words. Despite the groundbreaking work in the this area by Makanin, Razborov, Sela, Kharlampovich, Miasnikov and others, very few examples can be tackled, no implementation exists, and the area remains notoriously technical. 

On the strength of my expertise and long term preparatory work towards the objectives of this project, I will push forward both the theoretical and computational side of this area by linking nondeterministic algorithms to group theoretic and geometric approaches. I aim to map the essential features of the landscape more clearly and produce not only deep results, but also accessible literature and new algorithms.

1. An important research direction will be the formal language characterisation of solutions of equations and inequations, as well as definable sets, in the most important classes of infinite groups, such as free, hyperbolic or certain nilpotent and Artin groups. Our work will give a new, combinatorial description of sets that have a complex algebraic structure. 

2. Another goal of the project is to develop algorithms that solve equations in the Heisenberg group and dihedral Artin groups. At the moment no such algorithms exist, and these problems will require groundbreaking, novel approaches. 

3. The most ambitious goal of the project is to exploit the information lying at the core of the new, nondeterministic algorithm due to Diekert, Elder and myself in order to extract not just formal language characterisations, but the algebraic structure of varieties in free groups, and compare this to the information given by Makanin-Razborov diagrams.

The project's most innovative dimension is its authentic interdisciplinary nature: we will use tools from computer science and combinatorics to answer questions rooted in group theory, non-commutative algebraic geometry and logic, and vice versa, we will use algebraic and geometric results in order to improve and generalise the existing computational approaches.","Solving equations has always been a central question for mathematics. Whether searching for the roots of a polynomial or solving a differential equation, finding or approximating the solutions is an essential part of science, from pure to applied, and understanding the properties of the solutions opens up worlds of algebraic, dynamical, geometric or logical structure. 
 
This project centres on finding and understanding the solutions of equations in infinite nonabelian discrete groups, a topic at the wild frontier between solvable and unsolvable, with far-reaching applications to algebra, logic, geometry and theoretical computer science. Understanding solutions is crucial in order to expand algebraic geometry to a non-commutative setting, to master the first order theory of a structure, to determine isomorphism between two hyperbolic groups, to advance unification theory, and to answer questions about combinatorics on words. Despite the groundbreaking work in the this area by Makanin, Razborov, Sela, Kharlampovich, Miasnikov and others, very few examples can be tackled, no implementation exists, and the area remains notoriously technical. 

On the strength of my expertise and long term preparatory work towards the objectives of this project, I will push forward both the theoretical and computational side of this area by linking nondeterministic algorithms to group theoretic and geometric approaches. I aim to map the essential features of the landscape more clearly and produce not only deep results, but also accessible literature and new algorithms.

1. An important research direction will be the formal language characterisation of solutions of equations and inequations, as well as definable sets, in the most important classes of infinite groups, such as free, hyperbolic or certain nilpotent and Artin groups. Our work will give a new, combinatorial description of sets that have a complex algebraic structure. 

2. Another goal of the project is to develop algorithms that solve equations in the Heisenberg group and dihedral Artin groups. At the moment no such algorithms exist, and these problems will require groundbreaking, novel approaches.

For instance, identifying several large merchant ship classes such as barges, container ships, cargo ships and tankers from warships. The task seems similar to other well-studied image classification problems, however, it is much more challenging since the appearance of ships are easily affected by weather and lighting conditions, viewing geometry, as well as variability of the background against the sea surface. The low resolution of satellite imagery and the large within-class variations in some types of vessel make it a challenging task.Recently, exploitation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques to solve the target classification problem has been attempted by researchers. However, as pointed, neural network-based approaches to visual recognition typically require large quantities of training imagery to be successful. Ship recognition, like many other real-world vision tasks, suffers from a paucity of available data.Aiming at these problems, this project will develop advanced deep neural network models for effective identification of major types of ships from satellite images. Advanced machine learning techniques will also be adopted to address the limitation of example imagery.This project will develop a solution to these issues in three major steps:1. To mitigate the problem of sparse data in this domain, we will first collect ship imagery from public satellite image sources. We will then develop domain-specific data augmentation techniques, such as considering the orientation of ships??? principal axis to rotate samples effectively, considering ships??? placement to add background, scaling guided by the resolution of the sensors, etc., to effectively enlarge the size and coverage of training dataset. Depending on project needs, we may also explore applying a generative adversarial network (GAN) and its varieties to generate training images at either part-level, object-level or both.2. With image-level labels only, our solution will automatically identify distinctive local regions for generating part-level descriptions and estimate object bounding boxes for generating object-level descriptions. Meanwhile, we also look at the conventional attribute feature based solutions and attempt to fuse attribute features with part-level and object-level descriptions, depending on project needs.3. Part-level description and object-level description need to be fused and complement each other for ship type identification.

1,grant.7672868,NPRP10-0117-170176,Forward Osmosis Seawater Pretreatment for High Performance Thermal Desalination Plants,Forward Osmosis Seawater Pretreatment for High Performance Thermal Desalination Plants,"Energy, water and environment are the main pillars to a societyâ  s sustainable development. Fresh water availability is a vital issue to many countries in the world. In some arid areas where fresh water is not available, seawater desalination is the main method for fresh water supply. The commercially available seawater desalination processes are: Multi Stage Flashing (MSF) and Multi Effect Distillation (MED) for the thermal processes, whereas, Reverse Osmosis (RO) represents the membrane technology [1-5]. Thermal desalination provides more than 70% of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries desalinated water. High salinity and pollution of the gulf seawater are amongst the main reasons behind using thermal desalination technologies in the GCC region. The common trend in the GCC countries is a cogeneration-system of power-desalination plants which provides usable heat for desalination. A cogeneration-system is a convenient solution in the GCC region because of the large desalinated water requirements, relatively inexpensive energy costs, and elevated seawater salinity. 
The state of Qatar mainly relies on thermal desalination for fresh water production. Comparing between the thermal desalination processes, a commercial MED plant operates at a Top Brine Temperature (TBT) of 67 oC while a MSF plant operates at a TBT of around 120oC [5]. Using high TBTs is desirable for higher seawater recovery rates and higher Gained Output Ratio (GOR). However, high TBTs would accelerate the scale formation and deposition on the heat exchangers of the thermal plants. Alkaline scales have been reported in MED plants; where the main composition of the alkaline scale is CaCO3 [6,7]. At higher temperatures (i.e. MSF), MgSO4, Mg(OH)2 and CaSO4 scale has been reported [8]. Antiscalant is the current method for scale control in thermal desalination plants; different types of antiscalants are used for scale inhibition in thermal plants. However, antiscalant is not an effective method for scale prevention and becomes an ineffective method at high operating temperatures. For high TBT thermal plants, researchers have proposed Nano-filtration (NF) as a pretreatment process of seawater for the removal of monovalent and divalent ions which are responsible for scale formation. NF membranesâ   rejection rate for divalent ions may reach more than 90% but it is considered to be moderate/low for monovalent ions. In addition, pilot plant tests have revealed that NF pretreatment of seawater for thermal desalination was rather expensive. The filtration process requires about 15 bar to 25 bar and specific power consumption equal to 1 kWh/m3 for seawater pretreatment [7]. Partial NF pretreatment of seawater has been attempted to reduce the operational cost. In this process, about 30% of the seawater feed was filtered by NF then mixed with the cooling water to make the feed solution of the thermal plant. This allowed the TBT of a MSF thermal plant to reach 140 oC without a noticeable scale problem. Despite the pilot plant tests of NF pretreatment for seawater softening, the technology has not been yet commercialized where the major issue was the high power consumption. 
The current research project introduces a novel Forward Osmosis (FO) pretreatment of seawater for thermal desalination. All previous studies on this topic were only conceptual/theoretical studies where no experimental work has been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested technology neither on a bench scale nor on a pilot scale. The main objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate the feasibility of FO pretreatment for enhancing the performance of a thermal desalination plant. The enhancement of the quality of the feed to the thermal desalination plant is expected to reduce the power consumption of thermal process, increase the operation Top Brine Temperature (TBT), reduce antiscalant use and scale deposition. FO operates by the phenomenon of natural osmosis for fresh water extraction from saline solution; i.e. osmotic pressure is the main driving force. The development of a low cost draw solution is an urgent necessity for the FO process where it will considerably reduce the running cost of a FO unit. In this project brine reject from the thermal plant is proposed to be the draw solution in the FO process. This will reduce the cost of the draw solution. In addition, this will reduce the discharge of brine into the sea. Brine reject (draw solution) and seawater (feed solution) are fed into the FO process for fresh water extraction from seawater. Water permeation across the FO membrane will dilute the draw solution which will be the feed solution to the thermal plant. The concentrated seawater (feed solution) will go to the heat rejection unit to be used for cooling before discharging back to the sea. New FO membranes are able to reject divalent and monovalent ions at a rate higher than the NF and at a much lower operating cost. The FO pretreatment of seawater will allow the increase of thermal plants TBTs over the conventional limits; thus, the GOR and recovery rate are expected to be increased.
The successful implementation of FO-thermal desalination hybrid system will not only reduce the cost of thermal desalination but will also reduce the adverse environmental impacts. FO pretreatment will reduce brine discharge to the sea and the usage of chemicals. The project is a joint research between Qatar University (QU), Qatar, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation (Kahramaa) the University of Technology in Sydney (UTS), Australia, and Plataforma Solar De Almeria (PSA), Spain. The team members have diverse expertise in thermal and membrane separation processes which are required for the fulfillment of the proposed work. Consultants in membrane fouling and scaling will be outsourced from Pennsylvania State University (PSU), USA, and Institute on Membrane Technology (ITM-CNR), Italy.","Energy, water and environment are the main pillars to a societyâ  s sustainable development. Fresh water availability is a vital issue to many countries in the world. In some arid areas where fresh water is not available, seawater desalination is the main method for fresh water supply. The commercially available seawater desalination processes are: Multi Stage Flashing (MSF) and Multi Effect Distillation (MED) for the thermal processes, whereas, Reverse Osmosis (RO) represents the membrane technology [1-5]. Thermal desalination provides more than 70% of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries desalinated water. High salinity and pollution of the gulf seawater are amongst the main reasons behind using thermal desalination technologies in the GCC region. The common trend in the GCC countries is a cogeneration-system of power-desalination plants which provides usable heat for desalination. A cogeneration-system is a convenient solution in the GCC region because of the large desalinated water requirements, relatively inexpensive energy costs, and elevated seawater salinity. 
The state of Qatar mainly relies on thermal desalination for fresh water production. Comparing between the thermal desalination processes, a commercial MED plant operates at a Top Brine Temperature (TBT) of 67 oC while a MSF plant operates at a TBT of around 120oC [5]. Using high TBTs is desirable for higher seawater recovery rates and higher Gained Output Ratio (GOR). However, high TBTs would accelerate the scale formation and deposition on the heat exchangers of the thermal plants. Alkaline scales have been reported in MED plants; where the main composition of the alkaline scale is CaCO3 [6,7]. At higher temperatures (i.e. MSF), MgSO4, Mg(OH)2 and CaSO4 scale has been reported [8]. Antiscalant is the current method for scale control in thermal desalination plants; different types of antiscalants are used for scale inhibition in thermal plants. However, antiscalant is not an effective method for scale prevention and becomes an ineffective method at high operating temperatures. For high TBT thermal plants, researchers have proposed Nano-filtration (NF) as a pretreatment process of seawater for the removal of monovalent and divalent ions which are responsible for scale formation. NF membranesâ   rejection rate for divalent ions may reach more than 90% but it is considered to be moderate/low for monovalent ions. In addition, pilot plant tests have revealed that NF pretreatment of seawater for thermal desalination was rather expensive. The filtration process requires about 15 bar to 25 bar and specific power consumption equal to 1 kWh/m3 for seawater pretreatment [7]. Partial NF pretreatment of seawater has been attempted to reduce the operational cost. In this process, about 30% of the seawater feed was filtered by NF then mixed with the cooling water to make the feed solution of the thermal plant. This allowed the TBT of a MSF thermal plant to reach 140 oC without a noticeable scale problem. Despite the pilot plant tests of NF pretreatment for seawater softening, the technology has not been yet commercialized where the major issue was the high power consumption.

1,grant.7672938,NPRP10-1231-160069,Sustainable Reuse of Hypersaline Oil-Produced Water for Green Energy Production,Sustainable Reuse of Hypersaline Oil-Produced Water for Green Energy Production,"Crude oil and natural gas extraction and exploration in Qatar are associated with the co-production of significant volumes of wastewater, called â  produced water (PW)â  . For every barrel of oil extracted, three to ten barrels of PW are generated, making it the largest waste stream flow at oil production facilities. PW from oil production (hereafter, oil-PW) in Qatar is characterized by its very high salinity, being more than five times as saline as seawater, and this makes its reuse prohibitively costly. Thus, oil-PW is typically reinjected into the formation to maintain reservoir pressure and/or it is disposed via deep-well injection. In both cases, pretreatment is required to maintain injectability and minimize operational costs. 
Although the hypersalinity of oil-PW hinders its availability for reuse, this hypersalinity is a type of stored energy that can be converted into usable mechanical energy. Pressure-retarded Osmosis (PRO) is a process that can convert osmotic energy into electrical energy using a hydro-turbine and generator in a way that is similar to conventional hydropower plants. However, there are only very few rigorous studies of the capabilities and limitations of PRO when applied to hypersaline water with such complex composition as found in oil-PW. Harnessing osmotic energy effectively from oil-PW will require innovative process design and development, including a new generation of membranes. The high salinity and complex composition of oil-PW pose several challenges. The first challenge caused by the high osmotic pressure of oil-PW is the high operating hydraulic pressure that will be required to obtain peak power density. This requires the development of PRO membranes with high mechanical strength that can withstand high operating pressures. Another major challenge for PRO is the low power density and energy efficiency that is practically achievable compared to theoretical values. This limitation is the result of concentration polarization and membrane fouling. However, it will be challenging to fabricate PRO membranes that can withstand high pressures with a thin support layer that is necessary to minimize concentration polarization. Nevertheless, any gains in achieving higher hydraulic pressures will improve the efficiency of energy extraction, especially if an optimized PRO system is employed. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project is to define the fundamental behavior of the PRO system with novel design and components that uses high-performance membranes in order to develop a robust and highly efficient system for green energy generation utilizing oil-PW. 
In most of the previous studies of power production using PRO, low salinity waters such as fresh water or treated wastewater have been used as feed solution, with seawater or rejected brine from seawater desalination plants used as draw solution. However, freshwater is unavailable in Qatar and energy-intensive seawater desalination plants provide the main water supply for domestic use. Also, using treated wastewater as feed solution would waste a valuable water resource that is currently reused for beneficial purposes. As such, this project aims at adopting seawater or brine from brackish groundwater desalination plants as feed solution and oil-PW as draw solution. As all oil production facilities in Qatar are located either offshore or closely onshore, the easy availability of seawater makes the proposed system both feasible and rational. Seawater is several times less saline than oil-PW, maintaining a high osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution and the feed solution. Also, co-injection of PW and seawater has been found to improve oil recovery because seawater changes the wettability of formation reservoirs that are at high temperature. Thus, the proposed approach offers an opportunity to co-inject the effluent seawater feed stream with the effluent oil-PW draw stream for enhanced oil recovery at no additional cost. On the other hand, the brine from brackish groundwater desalination plants, which is a third as saline as seawater, would be a more attractive feed solution for onshore oil-PW, if these desalination plants are constructed close to onshore oil fields. This provides a strong potential to integrate the PRO system with brackish groundwater desalination so that the energy produced by the PRO can be used to partially power desalination plants, while the rejected brine from desalination plants can be utilized as feed solution in the PRO process.
This project aims to develop a sustainable approach to oil-PW reuse for green energy production by exploiting novel low fouling and robust thin-film composite (TFC) nanofibrous membranes tailored for PRO application using several innovative fabrication techniques and materials. The specific objectives are:
1. To advance the state of knowledge on manufacture of multi-layered TFC PRO membranes of a thin-film polyamide active layer, smooth surfaces, a highly porous and hydrophilic nanofibrous support, and high mechanical strength

2,grant.7672929,NPRP10-1210-160019,Solar-Powered Desalination Process Accompanying  CO2 Conversion and Water Purification,Solar-Powered Desalination Process Accompanying  CO2 Conversion and Water Purification,"Water and energy has been considered two critical issues facing humanity over the next 50 years because of rapid consumption of water and energy by continuously growing human population and increasing concern for the quality of life. To meet the demands, a seawater desalination process is one of the popular choices employed in many countries to make up deficient water supply.  However, traditional desalination processes are very energy intensive. Thus, an energy-saving desalination or desalination process producing an electric power has been recently emerged to save overall energy consumption required for operating the desalination process while recovering water. In addition to the issue of water and energy, an increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration is changing global climate as well as local weather, eventually threatening the security of possessing enough water, energy, and food locally and globally. In the Middle-East countries, many desalination plants are being operated together with fossil fuel based power plants, which contributes to additional release of CO2. Therefore, a novel holistic strategy for securing water and energy and protecting climate change from CO2 should be urgently developed and adopted especially at Qatar because â  Waterâ   and â  Energyâ   security now ranks in the top research priority among the Qatar National Research Strategies (QNRS) of Qatar Foundation (QF) to pursuit the Qatar National Vision (QNV) 2030.      

To comply with the main strategy of the QNRS, the project proposed here will develop a technology that can utilize chloride and sodium ions from saline water (brackish water, seawater, RO brine water) using a solar-powered electrochemical desalination process (â  SolEC-Desal Proâ  ) accompanying conversion of CO2 into production of value-added solar chemicals (VASCs) and water purification for water reuse. Unlike the desalination process recently reported, this SolEC-Desal Pro will be able to convert CO2 into solar chemicals and purify wastewater by maximally utilizing the salts (Cl-, Na+) separated from saline water desalination through membranes. This holistic approach is promising to building an infrastructure particularly for an environment with a plenty of saline water or wastewater near resource points of saline water such as seashore. 

Our proposed SolEC-Desal Pro will be composed of three chambers where the middle chamber for desalination (i.e., Desalinaton chamber) will be placed between the anode chamber and the cathode chamber under a given electric power supplied by photovoltaic (PV) system or sunlight as a source of renewable energy. The solar energy will initiate the movement of salt ions (e.g., Cl- and Na+) from the desalination chamber to oppositely charged electrode chambers through an anionic exchange membrane (AEM) for Cl- ion and a cationic exchange membrane (CEM) for Na+, respectively, finally leading to recovery of the desalinated water in the middle chamber. In order to maximally utilize both salt ions and electrically biased electrodes, chemical reactions that can drive water purification and production of VASCs will take place at anode and cathode, respectively. Herein, CO2 gas will flow into the cathode chamber where cost-effective metal electrodes (e.g., Cu foam, 3D carbon nanotube sponge) or photoelectrode (CuAlO2) will be used, coupled with an anode chamber where wastewater will be in contact with metal-doped oxides (e.g., Ni/Sb-co-doped SnO2, Bi-TiO2/IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti) anodes or nanostructured oxide (e.g., hydrogen treated TiO2 nanotube arrays) photoanode. In the anode chamber, wastewater will be purified by chemical oxidation using reactive chlorine species (e.g., Clâ ¢, Cl2â ¢-, HOCl/OCl-), which are in-situ produced by (photo)electrochemical oxidation of the transferred Cl- ions at the anode. The CO2 purged to the cathode chamber will be converted into VASCs (e.g., H2, CO, formate, etc) by taking electrons transferred from anode. 

The performance of â  Water Purification-Desalination-CO2 conversionâ   at each chamber will be evaluated at first with simple lab-scale three compartment-configured reactors until the device configuration and electrode/membrane materials are optimized under various environmental conditions and operational parameters. The optimized SolEC-Desal Pro will be scaled up with an all-in-one tubular or rectangular configuration of all chambers where a proton exchange membrane (PEM) will be placed along with the AEM and CEM between tubular-shaped anode and cathode. Herein, insertion of the PEM will boost the proton-coupled electron transfer reactions at the cathode. Apparently, the tubular or rectangular configuration is to continuously produce VASCs at cathode as well as continuous water purification at anode while desalinating seawater at the tubularâ  shaped desalination chamber surrounded with AEM and CEM in order to provide Cl- and Na+ to each electrode chamber.","Water and energy has been considered two critical issues facing humanity over the next 50 years because of rapid consumption of water and energy by continuously growing human population and increasing concern for the quality of life.

3,grant.7850250,417283954,"Novel approaches for a highly sensitive, quantitative and three-dimensional multiplexed analysis by means of hyphenated techniques to investigate the zinc transporter pathway in the ageing mouse brain","Novel approaches for a highly sensitive, quantitative and three-dimensional multiplexed analysis by means of hyphenated techniques to investigate the zinc transporter pathway in the ageing mouse brain","The levels of numerous zinc transporter proteins as well as of associated biomolecules within the brain play a crucial role in learning, memory as well as in cognitive decline. Nevertheless, the cellular and molecular background remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this research project is to develop novel, highly sensitive technology for the investigation of the zinc transporter pathway and its age-related alteration in brain tissue of mice as model organism. This will produce data concerning the role of zinc and associated transporter protein alterations across age for the first time. The innovation of this proposal is based on the development and application of highly sensitive, quantitative and multiplexed elemental and molecular imaging by immunohistochemistry (IHC)-assisted laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and its expansion into three dimensions. In order to perform quantitative multiplexing by LA-ICP-MS, antibodies will be conjugated with stable isotope enriched lanthanides detectable via ICP-MS. A robust analytic workflow for the characterisation of labelled antibodies based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC)-ICP-MS will be developed and applied. The combination of a sensitive detection method employing collision cell technology and on-line isotope dilution analysis (IDA) will be the basis for a rapid on-site quality control of labelled antibodies and will enable to determine the antibody/metal stoichiometry.In a second step, a robust IHC method employing the labelled antibodies will be developed in order to perform a multiplexed analysis of selected zinc transporter proteins in mouse brain tissue by LA-ICP-MS. The in the first part developed SEC-ICP-MS method will be the basis to relate the zinc transporter protein concentration with the metal content within the antibodies’ label. To obtain quantitative mapping data, a new calibration method shall be established exploiting the fact that multiplexing protocols deploy stable isotope enriched lanthanides. A new on-line IDA technique for LA-ICP-MS will be developed to perform accurate, sensitive and fast quantification. Sensitivities will subsequently be maximised by optimising the instrumentation to enhance image contrasts and resolutions.The combination of the aforementioned hyphenated techniques will finally allow to investigate the expression of selected Zn transporter proteins and biologically relevant elements in mouse brain tissue. Brains of mice across different ages and with distinct cognitive abilities will be studied in order to understand basic age-related alterations in these key cellular elements, which are believed to play a role in memory through control of the cellular homeostasis of zinc. A three-dimensional multiplexing approach will finally be established in order to generate a mouse brain atlas containing the distributions of zinc and its transporter proteins.","The levels of numerous zinc transporter proteins as well as of associated biomolecules within the brain play a crucial role in learning, memory as well as in cognitive decline.

Yet, there is an increasing demand for ocean space resulting from expanding use of the marine environment, and a growing awareness that much of the marine environment is deteriorating. In response a need for marine planning (MP) has grown globally to ensure sustainable use of marine space and extraction of its resources. This is particularly evident in E and SE Asia, where conflicts over marine space and resources are growing, added to by pressures of population growth
The capacity to implement MP throughout E and SE Asia is largely lacking and presents an overarching challenge: to improve the integrated management of marine and coastal environments to reduce conflict between users, mitigate risks associated with expanded or new uses, and protect fragile ecosystems while supporting livelihoods, food security, health and well-being of coastal communities. We will achieve this through collaborative international, interdisciplinary research, training and capacity building. Activities will focus on learning-by-doing among researchers, local stakeholders, and local communities to deliver research outcomes with potential for impact. We have five sub-challenges to address, aligning with three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG1 no poverty; SDG2 zero hunger; and SDG3 good health and well-being):
Challenge 1: Promote sustainable harvesting by reducing overexploitation of seafood and degradation of the environments, and promoting sustainable management of wild capture seafood and production of seafood through aquaculture. 
Challenge 2: Prepare for climate change by understanding its direct and indirect effects on coastal communities and anticipating and mitigating the impacts e.g. coastal wetlands, reefs and mangroves dampen the effects of flooding, storms and tsunamis; their management plays a key role on human wellbeing beyond being sources of food. 
Challenge 3: Promote good health: we aim to show how improved management of marine ecosystems may promote health and wellbeing benefits, including but not limited to food and nutrition, and reduce the health risks that arise from degraded and overexploited ecosystems. 
Challenge 4: Identify opportunities for future growth: improved management can provide additional, sustainable, opportunities for growth via technologies such as marine renewable energy. We will need to recognise and account for synergies and trade-offs among uses of the marine environment under MP.
Challenge 5: Co-development and implementation of MP: marine plans need to be culturally-acceptable, facilitate growth of, and reduce risks to and conflicts among users of the marine environment, and simultaneously contribute to improving livelihoods, health and wellbeing and ensuring sustainable use of marine ecosystems.
We will focus research, (and learning-by-doing), on case studies in UNESCO Biosphere Reserves in Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines and China and marine protected areas in Malaysia. 
Ultimately this project will deliver economic, social, health and wellbeing and environmental benefits to coastal communities in SE Asia via co-development of local research capacity, stakeholder engagement, and application of contextually relevant tools for MP that will endure well beyond the four-year programme.

There is a strong, credible body of evidence, suggesting that mobile network operators are facing many formidable tasks but exciting areas of endeavour. Of most concern is the increase in ever-growing wireless/mobile devices and the huge demand in data rates associated with this. It is predicted that the number of mobile-connected devices will exceed 11.5 billion by 2019 (nearly 1.5 mobile devices per capita), which poses a huge traffic demand for ubiquitous communications. On the one hand, it is anticipated that we will witness an up to 10000- fold growth in wireless data traffic by the year 2030, and that of the UK alone is projected to increase between 23-fold and 297-fold over the period 2012-2030. 
The future 5G cellular network is expected to achieve as much as 1000 times data rate relative to its current 4G counterpart. On the one hand, as many as 50 billion devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020 request seamless connectivity and mobility. Data rates are projected to increase by a factor of ten every five years, and with the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) predicted to wirelessly connect trillions of devices across the globe, without novel approaches, future mobile networks (5G) will grind to a halt unless more capacity is created. 
One of the most attractive solutions is the implementation of ultra-dense networks constituted by the combination of macro-cells and small-cells and exploited the emerging technologies of millimetre wave (mm-wave) frequency bands, large-scale antennas arrays. But while these enabling technologies constitute one of the most attractive approaches, i.e., ultra-dense cellular networks, to improving the capacity and coverage of wireless systems, the ""ultra-dense"" aspect poses fundamental challenges, which urgently require solutions.
Most importantly, the tool of system-level performance evaluation and optimization is very essential for telecommunication service providers. However, it is usually conducted by relying on numerical simulations, which are often time-consuming and even extremely difficult in the context of 5G ultra-dense networks. At present, no sound but essential mathematical methodologies towards the design of practical communication protocols and transmission techniques for ultra-dense heterogeneous cellular networks are available.
Motivated by this lack of tractable solution, this research project proposes a mathematical model to take into account the practical aspects of 5G ultra-dense networks, i.e., highly dense distribution, dynamic random topologies, and heterogeneous interference. The unique feature of the project is to augment the recent advances in mathematics, random process, and signal processing theory involved by both base stations and mobile devices in ultra-dense cellular networks for recovering the transmitted voice, data, video, etc. This allows us to integrate interference management between large and small cells along with a large number of transmit/receive antennas and higher transmission bandwidth in mm-wave frequency bands. These include the development of new theoretical framework that is informed by the limitations of a practical system not currently considered in the context of ""extremely dense networks"" of current cellular systems.","Wireless communications technology enables us to seamlessly access many multimedia services, e.g., stored multimedia (e.g., video on-demand), live streaming (e.g., Internet live sport networks, Internet radio stations), and realtime interactive streaming (e.g., online games, video conference, e-education), etc. As such, wireless communications technology has rapidly gained a crucial role and become an important aspect of life.

However, it is usually conducted by relying on numerical simulations, which are often time-consuming and even extremely difficult in the context of 5G ultra-dense networks. At present, no sound but essential mathematical methodologies towards the design of practical communication protocols and transmission techniques for ultra-dense heterogeneous cellular networks are available.
Motivated by this lack of tractable solution, this research project proposes a mathematical model to take into account the practical aspects of 5G ultra-dense networks, i.e., highly dense distribution, dynamic random topologies, and heterogeneous interference. The unique feature of the project is to augment the recent advances in mathematics, random process, and signal processing theory involved by both base stations and mobile devices in ultra-dense cellular networks for recovering the transmitted voice, data, video, etc. This allows us to integrate interference management between large and small cells along with a large number of transmit/receive antennas and higher transmission bandwidth in mm-wave frequency bands. These include the development of new theoretical framework that is informed by the limitations of a practical system not currently considered in the context of ""extremely dense networks"" of current cellular systems.",96857,GBP,162727,31/05/2017,2017,30/08/2018,2018,Trung Q.

2,grant.6619547,NE/P012671/1,A multidisciplinary study of DMSP production and lysis - from enzymes to organisms to process modelling.,A multidisciplinary study of DMSP production and lysis - from enzymes to organisms to process modelling.,"A billion tonnes of the compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is made each year by marine phytoplankton, seaweeds, corals, coastal plants and, as shown by us, marine bacteria. DMSP has key roles in marine ecosystems when released into the environment, serving as an osmoprotectant and key nutrient for marine microbial communities. DMSP is also the main precursor of the climate-cooling gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). Many organisms cleave DMSP, producing ~300 million tonnes of DMS annually, ~10 % of which is released into the air. DMS oxidises in the atmosphere, producing aerosols that can lead to increased cloud cover and potential effects on climate, or be returned to land in rain, a key step in the global sulfur cycle. DMSP and DMS are also chemoattractants for many organisms which associate them with food.

Despite the importance of DMSP, knowledge of how and why it is produced is quite superficial. We know that DMSP and DMS production is highly variable between and within the different groups of producers, but the reasons for this variability are not understood, mainly because genes encoding DMSP synthesis enzymes have yet to be identified and DMSP lyases have only just been identified in a DMSP-producing organism.

Our preliminary work has identified dsy genes which encode key DMSP synthesis enzymes in bacteria, diatoms, dinoflagellates, corals and haptophytes - the major groups of marine DMSP-producers. Variability in DMSP/DMS production may stem from their different Dsy enzymes.

Our aim is to establish ""why some organisms make more DMSP than others and the contribution of different organisms to global DMSP and DMS production"".

It is possible that variability in DMSP production in different organisms stems from the differing efficiencies or expression of their Dsy enzymes. To test this, we will use biochemical techniques to characterise the different Dsy enzymes of the major classes of DMSP-producers.

We will study how diverse, model DMSP-producers express their DMSP and DMS synthesis enzymes in response to varying conditions, since the expression level may govern the amount of DMSP produced. This may shed light on the effects of climate change, e.g., if Dsy and DMSP lyase expression is increased by higher temperatures. For the important DMSP/DMS-producing algae Emiliania huxleyi and Symbiodinium, we will precisely locate the Dsy enzymes within the cell as this will help in understanding the role(s) of DMSP in these organisms. By relating cellular location and Dsy enzymology data to DMSP (and synthesis intermediates) and DMS concentrations, production rates in key DMSP producers and the conditions that enhance accumulation, we will more fully understand why high variability in DMSP and DMS production exists. 

As future changes in environmental conditions will likely affect DMSP/DMS production, and potentially climate, and vice versa, it is important to understand and predict these effects. Current estimates of DMSP/DMS production are likely inaccurate due to a lack of integrated studies combining molecular, biogeochemical, process and modelling data. Here, we will carry out a detailed, year-long study at the coastal site L4 in the English Channel (chosen for its location and range of contextual data). We will study the diversity and expression of key genes in DMSP/DMS synthesis, DMSP synthesis rates, group-specific phytoplankton DMSP production, bulk standing stocks of DMSP (and synthesis intermediates) and DMS and microbial diversity over a seasonal succession. Our studies will tell us which organisms produce DMSP/DMS, production rates and concentrations, the genes used and under what conditions. Using these data, we will input critical state and rate parameters into a new model for DMSP/DMS dynamics, allowing the contribution of different taxa to global production of DMSP/DMS to be more accurately predicted, along with any possible effects of climate change.","A billion tonnes of the compatible solute dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is made each year by marine phytoplankton, seaweeds, corals, coastal plants and, as shown by us, marine bacteria.

Phosphorus is an essential element for both plant and animal growth and is not replaceable by other elements. In the last 50 years phosphate fertilisers have enhanced crop yields, providing food for billions of people and livestock. World food security is dependent on sufficient access to phosphorus fertilisers for farmers. However, the main source of phosphorus for fertilisers is mining of rocks found only in a few countries, mainly located in politically unstable regions of the world. Many countries, including the UK, rely on imports of phosphate rock for food production. With increasing human population growth and changes in, the worldwide demand for rock phosphate reserves has increased significantly and is projected to continue in the future. Consequently, rock reserves of phosphate are becoming increasingly scarce and the reserves that remain are of poorer quality, often being contaminated with the potentially toxic elements, uranium and cadmium. These concerns have driven fluctuations of fertiliser price and potential political instability. Currently a sixth of the world's farmers cannot afford P fertilisers. At the same time, the mobilisation of phosphorus into the environment has increased fourfold due to greater use of phosphorus fertilisers and uptake and excretion of phosphorus-containing food by the growing human population. The resulting increased phosphorus concentrations in rivers, lakes and coastal waters is causing widespread eutrophication, characterised by toxic algal blooms, oxygen ""dead zones"" and fish kills. Eutrophication is considered the greatest cause of damage to freshwater ecosystems on the planet.

What is needed? Phosphorus security is critical for realising many goals of global society. These include food security and provision of clean water, integrity of ecosystems and fertile soils, maintaining livelihoods, human health and geopolitical security. However, there is little global joined-up thinking about how we can deliver a secure phosphorus future. While the underlying science is key to understanding the nature of the problem and devising technical solutions, our understanding of phosphorus science and technology is only one part of the solution. There is a lack of policy at regional or global scales relating to phosphorus, with phosphorus remaining chronically under-represented within the public consciousness. The United Nations Environment Programme has acknowledged a critical need to identify how we manage phosphorus. 

What this project delivers. Recognising these global challenges, the 'Our Phosphorus Future' project aims to provide scientific consensus from the global scientific phosphorus community on how to best deliver phosphorus security.

It will be launched at high profile events and will also be freely-available online.

Oyster farming contributes almost $100 million to the Australian economy each year and is a cornerstone of coastal communities, but has been decimated by diseases that threaten this important primary industry. While some causative pathogens have been identified, the environmental catalysts of oyster disease remain a mystery. The expected outcome of this project is an innovative coupling of tools that provides new capacity to forecast disease events, delivering the Australian oyster industry a powerful platform to predict, manage and prevent costly disease outbreaks. By identifying environmental thresholds and oyster disease danger periods, an expected outcome of this project is the development of new oyster farming strategies aimed at avoiding multi-million dollar losses associated with disease outbreaks.","This project aims to unite cutting-edge genomic and molecular biological tools with novel quantitative modelling analyses to identify the mechanisms behind oyster disease events.

2,grant.6504193,734790,Blood test for clinical therapy guidance of non-small cell lung cancer patients,Blood test for clinical therapy guidance of non-small cell lung cancer patients,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC alone make up about 75% of all lung cancers and most hospitals currently test all NSCLC patients for EGFR mutations (pharmacogenomics) for treatment decision (personalised medicine) – i.e., patients with mutation(s) in EGFR gene should receive a EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) drug (e.g. afitinib) treatment; while those that do not present mutations in such gene, should be treated with chemotherapy. Currently, the laboratories use PCR and Sanger sequencing technologies to perform the EGFR analysis from tumour biopsies - Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples. Still, some patients (e.g., 30% in UK) may never get histological confirmation because they are too sick to make a biopsy. Furthermore, the results obtained with current methods still present low quality, mainly due to poor quality/low yield of DNA extracted from FFPE samples. The FP7 LungCARD project (www.lungcard.eu) has developed and demonstrated a LungCARD system - an automatic system composed by microfluidic chip and chip analyser - that allows to capture circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from blood samples, amplify by multiplex PCR and detect EGFR mutations, including also a software for data analysis and report. Although this new blood test has proven to be faster, cost-effective and human error-free, the detection of somatic mutations in EGFR gene at frequencies lower than 20% is still a weak point. 
Therefore, the main project’s goal is to benefit from this technology, through the development, improvement, integration and validation of the LungCARD system with NGS workflow and development of a software for automatic reporting clinical results. However, LungCARD project aims to go further, by putting together a global and unique network of multidisciplinary scientists for exchange of knowledge and research training focused on non-small cell lung cancer.","Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide.

Among those gases, SO2 and H2S are of great concern as potential air pollutants in the Middle-Eastern countries, including Qatar. Thus, in-situ pretreatment method has been widely employed to lessen emission of these gases from the point sources. Unlike general treatment methods commonly used, this research is proposing the utilization of these gases towards production of renewable hydrogen energy by the photoelectrochemical (PEC) process and diluted fertilizer water by the forward osmosis (FO) desalination process for agricultural irrigation. To initiate the designed process, production of sulfite or bisulfide is prerequisite, which will be produced by purging SO2 or H2S into alkaline solution. These produced sulfur-based chemicals will function as seed solution, which will then be used in the subsequent PEC process as electron donors and in the FO process as draw solution. Our final goal of the proposed research is to convert air-polluting gases into potential chemical seed solutions that are able to trigger development of integrated technology for production of energy and cultivation of agricultural plants or crops through desalination of saline water. To pursue these goals, the following five major aims are proposed: (1) Develop analytical and experimental procedures, (2) Develop photoelectrochemical (PEC) process for sustainable hydrogen production, (3) Develop sulfur-based seed solution (SBSS)-driven forward osmosis (FO) process for the desalination of saline water for agricultural application, (4) Combine SBSS-driven PEC-FO process and scale up for sustainable production of hydrogen and fertilizer, and (5) Develop knowledge and problem-solving capacities for researchers and practicing engineers in the state of Qatar.","High-level concentration of sulfur-containing gas is being detected in the atmosphere of many countries, typically resulting from production of hydrocarbon-based fuels such as natural gas, coal, or petroleum.

Its main object is the trace resulting from a criminal activity. In this context, the proposed project focuses more precisely on one type of trace, the fingermark and related methods for its detection, in particular because fingermarks remain largely used for identification purposes. It forms indeed a vast and dynamic area of research with over 100 new papers published annually in peer-reviewed journals. However, despite the research effort, current techniques still lack sensitivity. Therefore, this project focuses on fingermark detection with nanoparticles, and more precisely on a promising nanoparticles type not commonly used for fingermark detection: silicon oxide. It regroups all the necessary properties requested for an effective detection tools and offers several advantages over the other nanoparticles already used in the field. Size, optical characteristics and surfaces properties can be adjusted at will. Silicon oxide nanoparticles have versatile surface modification abilities; various functional groups can be grafted onto their surface, leading to precise targeting of the fingermark secretion components. Their optical properties can be tuned to fulfil forensic optical requirements by introducing a luminescent dye in their inner structure. Beside a thorough study of nanoparticles characteristics and a detailed understanding of interaction with the residue, this project aims at proposing a detection technique with a proven better sensibility and selectivity that would be realistically applicable by practitioners. After having determined the optimum parameters and application mode, the focus will be directed towards designing a user friendly and cost effective technique that will be applicable in standard police laboratories, as well as at the crime scene.","Forensic science assists law enforcement and criminal justice in its search for the truth and relates to the application of scientific knowledge and technical methods to legal issues.

2,grant.4295147,NE/N002385/1,Bacteria make DMSP - how significant is this process?,Bacteria make DMSP - how significant is this process?,"Globally, a billion tons of the sulfur-containing molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is made each year. The common belief was that DMSP is only made by marine eukaryotes, including phytoplankton, seaweeds, a few plants and some corals, but our preliminary work shows that marine bacteria also make DMSP, and at levels similar to those reported for some phytoplankton. For the first time, we have shown that marine bacteria likely use DMSP as an osmoprotectant to buffer cells against the salinity of seawater. The research that we propose will redefine the field of DMSP production and its catabolism.

DMSP is the main precursor of the environmentally important gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). Microbial DMSP lysis generates ~300 million tons of DMS per annum. Much of this DMS is used by bacteria, but ~10 % is released from the seas into the air, giving the seaside its characteristic smell. Once in the atmosphere, chemical products arising from DMS oxidation aid cloud formation over the oceans, to an extent that affects sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, with effects on climate. In turn, these products are delivered back to Earth as rain, representing a key component of the global sulfur cycle. DMS is also a potent chemoattractant for many organisms including seabirds, crustaceans and marine mammals, which associate DMS with food.

Although previous studies have described the pathways for DMSP synthesis, remarkably NONE of the enzymes or corresponding genes have been identified in ANY DMSP-producing organism.

Our preliminary data:
1. show that some marine bacteria make DMSP via the same pathway used by phytoplankton.
2. identified the key gene in bacterial DMSP production ""mmtB"" - the first gene shown to be involved in DMSP synthesis in any organism.
3. show that our model marine bacterium Labrenzia likely makes DMSP as an osmoprotectant.
4. show that bacteria containing mmtB produce DMSP, and some also contain DMSP lyase genes whose products liberate DMS from DMSP.
5. show that the mmtB gene is abundant in marine environments.

The mmtB gene encodes an enzyme that catalyses one of the four predicted steps in DMSP synthesis, but we do not know the identity the other three genes. To fully understand the process of DMSP synthesis in bacteria, we need to identify the missing synthesis genes so that we can study their regulation and enzymology. We will use complementary molecular genetic approaches to identify the unknown DMSP synthesis genes and, in the process, characterise the full complement of genes whose expression is affected by salinity in Labrenzia.
To understand how and why bacteria in the environment produce DMSP and DMS, we will study key model bacteria isolated from marine samples. These bacteria will be grown in microcosms under conditions similar to those of their natural habitat, and their environmental growth conditions will be varied whilst monitoring DMS and DMSP synthesis, at both the process and gene expression level. This will indicate whether environmental factors such as temperature, oxidative stress, etc., affect the production of DMSP and concomitantly the production of the climate-active gas DMS.

The importance of bacterial DMSP production in marine environments will be examined. We will sample selected marine environments and investigate the activity of bacterial DMSP synthesis compared to eukaryotic DMS/DMSP pathways. We will determine if the environmental factors that regulate DMS/DMSP production in our model bacteria have the same effect on natural microbial communities that are present in important marine environments. We will also use a powerful suite of microbial ecology techniques, combined with molecular genetic tools, to identify the microbes and key genes involved in producing DMSP via the MmtB enzyme in these environments. This work will help us in the future to model how changes in the environment impact on the balance of these climate processes.","Globally, a billion tons of the sulfur-containing molecule dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is made each year. The common belief was that DMSP is only made by marine eukaryotes, including phytoplankton, seaweeds, a few plants and some corals, but our preliminary work shows that marine bacteria also make DMSP, and at levels similar to those reported for some phytoplankton. For the first time, we have shown that marine bacteria likely use DMSP as an osmoprotectant to buffer cells against the salinity of seawater. The research that we propose will redefine the field of DMSP production and its catabolism.

DMSP is the main precursor of the environmentally important gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). Microbial DMSP lysis generates ~300 million tons of DMS per annum. Much of this DMS is used by bacteria, but ~10 % is released from the seas into the air, giving the seaside its characteristic smell. Once in the atmosphere, chemical products arising from DMS oxidation aid cloud formation over the oceans, to an extent that affects sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, with effects on climate. In turn, these products are delivered back to Earth as rain, representing a key component of the global sulfur cycle. DMS is also a potent chemoattractant for many organisms including seabirds, crustaceans and marine mammals, which associate DMS with food.

Although previous studies have described the pathways for DMSP synthesis, remarkably NONE of the enzymes or corresponding genes have been identified in ANY DMSP-producing organism.

Our preliminary data:
1. show that some marine bacteria make DMSP via the same pathway used by phytoplankton.
2. identified the key gene in bacterial DMSP production ""mmtB"" - the first gene shown to be involved in DMSP synthesis in any organism.
3. show that our model marine bacterium Labrenzia likely makes DMSP as an osmoprotectant.
4. show that bacteria containing mmtB produce DMSP, and some also contain DMSP lyase genes whose products liberate DMS from DMSP.
5. show that the mmtB gene is abundant in marine environments.

Data security is important to clients – typical applications for quantum computing will involve commercially or strategically sensitive data. Developing these security protocols is expected to enable the commercialisation of quantum computing, enhancing their adoption and accessibility.",652000,AUD,652000,1/01/2016,2016,31/12/2019,2019,Peter Rohde,University of Technology Sydney,University of Technology Sydney; Singapore University of Technology and Design; University of Bristol,grid.117476.2; grid.263662.5; grid.5337.2,Sydney; Singapore; Bristol,New South Wales; ; ,Australia; Singapore; United Kingdom,Australian Research Council,,Australia,pub.1100954737; pub.1103306615; pub.1125737103; pub.1084199172; pub.1101062380; pub.1091357880; pub.1112705592; pub.1124451693,http://purl.org/au-research/grants/arc/FT160100397,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.6444148,0803 Computer Software; 0802 Computation Theory and Mathematics; 0804 Data Format; 08 Information and Computing Sciences; 08 Information and Computing Sciences; 08 Information and Computing Sciences,Networking and Information Technology R&D,,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,
3,grant.5240290,164715,Microparticles in human parasitic diseases: source of biomarkers and role in disease pathogenesis?,Microparticles in human parasitic diseases: source of biomarkers and role in disease pathogenesis?,"Parasitic diseases, and in particular vector borne diseases, are responsible for 17% of the estimated global burden of all infectious diseases. Malaria, leishmaniasis, yellow fever, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Chagas disease are just some examples. Among them, malaria is responsible for the highest number of deaths occurring mainly in children under the age of 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. The pathogenesis of these diseases is usually complicated and characterised by fine, and often unclear, interactions between the parasite and the host. This is the case for malaria and HAT, the two principal subjects of this project. Despite being very different in aetiology and pathogenesis, they are both characterised by a cerebral involvement - cerebral malaria (CM) and meningo-encephalitic HAT stage - which can be associated to patients’ death or long-term neurological deficits.The objective of this proposal is to investigate the role of microparticles (MP) in both CM and HAT. MP are extracellular vesicles, released by all cell types under stress or apoptotic conditions, which carry protein, nucleic acids and lipids derived from the cytoplasm of the mother cell. Their increased number in the circulation of CM patients has already been shown and their role in CM pathogenesis has been proposed. Here, we hypothesise that deciphering the protein cargo of plasma MP in CM patients will contribute in revealing new pathophysiological mechanisms and disease biomarkers. MP cargo from CM patients with good and poor outcome will be compared to highlight proteins associated with disease severity and with prognostic potential. Most promising proteins will be further verified on a larger number of patients to evaluate their potential as prognostic markers. Moreover, to evaluate their cellular source and their packaging into MP, the most interesting proteins - together with S100A8 and S100A9 discovered in our preliminary investigations - will also be investigated using and in vitro model of CM.In this project we also postulate that, similarly to CM, MP might also be involved in HAT, and in particular in the mechanisms of disease progression to the meningo-encephalitic stage and in the consequent neuro-inflammation and cerebral disease. To verify this hypothesis we will evaluate MP number and phenotype in the cerebrospinal fluid of HAT patients at different stage of disease progression. The results obtained might reveal new features of HAT pathogenesis paving the way to future investigations.","Parasitic diseases, and in particular vector borne diseases, are responsible for 17% of the estimated global burden of all infectious diseases.

Crime and safety in Aboriginal communities remains a major concern. NPs, an Australian innovation developed by Aboriginal communities, have become key players in local crime reduction strategies, and carry the endorsement of both government and Aboriginal communities. However, they are operating in an environment of increased ‘top-down’ control and regulation. Does greater accountability to government weaken NP’s ‘cultural’ accountability to communities?

It is therefore of great importance to understand why and how some information (e.g. some memes) spreads virally with great ease, while other is met with disinterest and omission. Uncovering the reasons may allow promoting important information, like warnings about cyber-attacks, while stifle harmful rumors, such as vaccines causing autism. The aim of the project is to treat the vast complexity of such information dynamics in social systems by involving researchers in social sciences, journalism, computing, data mining and complexity science.
The Project’s objectives are:
- discovery and reverse-engineering the mechanisms of information spreading in social media, such as dynamics of news releases, blog and internet for posts, Twitter messages, e-mails etc.,
- training and exchange of knowledge between partners in different domains coming from Warsaw University of Technology, Jozef Stefan Institute, Wroclaw University of Technology and leading world universities Stanford University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Nanyang Technological University,
- bidirectional knowledge transfer between academia and media industry (Slovenian Press Agency) by exposing researchers to real-life problems and giving business access to innovative methods and tools for information analysis.

The project will be based on three pillars: data acquisition, data mining/machine learning and complex systems modeling. The specific problems addressed will include understanding rules of and predicting information spreading in different media and about different topics, finding information sources and uncovering hidden information channels.

The secondments will accelerate individual careers of involved researchers, especially early stage ones. The project will lay foundations for long-term collaboration by strengthening existing links between partners and creating new ones.","In today's world, access to information is a decisive factor advancing industry, society and even culture.

2,grant.4456333,AH/M009548/1,Convict Australia and Utilitarianism: Jeremy Bentham's 'Writings on Australia',Convict Australia and Utilitarianism: Jeremy Bentham's 'Writings on Australia',"The history of convict transportation, and in particular the emergence of Australia as a political state, is a subject of mounting interest, both within academic circles and among the general public. The critical period was the very end of the eighteenth century and the first half of the nineteenth century, when the opening up of Australia, in the first place for transported felons, and in the next place for free settlers, gave rise to debates about crime and punishment, colonialism, and imperialism. One of the most important contributors to this debate was the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), whose writings on Australia were drawn upon by opponents of convict transportation in order to change the policy of the British government. There is, however, no authoritative and hence satisfactory edition of Bentham's writings on the subject. Hence, the centrepiece of this research is a critical edition of Bentham's 'Writings on Australia', which will form part of the Collected Works of Jeremy Bentham, and will be published by the Clarendon Press. Open access versions of the texts will be made freely available online. The volume will contain 'Panopticon versus New South Wales', 'A Plea for the Constitution' (both written in 1802, and eventually published in 1812), and 'Colonization Society Proposal' (written in 1831, but never hitherto published). In the first two texts, Bentham argued that transportation did not fulfil the proper ends of punishment, namely deterrence and reform, and that the policy of transportation was unconstitutional. The printed texts of these two works will be supplemented by the original manuscripts in University College London Library, which contain early drafts and a substantial unpublished addition for 'Plea for the Constitution'. The drafts are particularly important in that they are more radical and confrontational than the printed texts, and show that Bentham may have moderated his views because of fears of prosecution for sedition. In the third text, influenced by Edward Gibbon Wakefield's systematic colonization system, Bentham argues in favour of establishing a free, democratic colony, a project that came to fruition in South Australia. The volume will contain full historical annotation, an editorial introduction, and name and subject indexes. Seminal texts in the history of transportation and colonization will be made available for the first time in an authoritative edition.
 The researchers will produce original interpretive scholarship that will investigate (1) the relationship between Bentham's writings on Australia and his penal theory more generally, as well as their place in the development of his political radicalism; (2) the influence and impact of Bentham's ideas on the theory and practice of punishment in convict Australia; and (3) the influence and impact of Bentham's ideas on advocates and opponents of transportation and colonization in the first half of the nineteenth century, which have in turn shaped perceptions of Australian history ever since. A conference will be held with the aim of to assessing still further the significance of the new edition of Bentham's writings, and to stimulate new research on the intellectual history and theory of colonialism, liberalism, and imperialism, from a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including philosophy, law, and history. The conference will in turn give rise to a collection of edited essays.
 The project will engage the interest of the general public in its research through a regular series of blogs and tweets, a YouTube video highlighting the significance of Bentham's views on convict Australia, and the exploitation of our contacts with the media.","The history of convict transportation, and in particular the emergence of Australia as a political state, is a subject of mounting interest, both within academic circles and among the general public.

Betaine production in organisms protects against osmotic, temperature and drought stresses and its release into the environment provides dissolved organic nitrogen. Also, it is desirable for crops to have high betaine levels due to its wide-ranging health benefits. Betaine synthesis is well understood in many organisms but there are no detailed studies on betaine synthesis in any marine eukaryotic phytoplankton - not a single synthesis gene is reported.

Using diatoms as model phytoplankton we have identified a betaine synthase gene that when cloned in Escherichia coli confers enhanced salt tolerance and the ability to produce betaine from glycine. With the need to maximize nutritional value and crop production in the modern world, science has successfully explored transgenic introduction of betaine synthesis genes into crop plants to enhance their stress tolerance and betaine production. Given that the diatom synthase has no significant identity to any characterised betaine synthesis enzyme, it is a good candidate for transgenic stress tolerance studies in higher plants.

This PhD aims to demonstrate the role of this betaine synthase in Thalassiosira pseudonana via overexpression and knocking down of the corresponding gene in this model diatom. We will study gene regulation and the physiology of transgenic diatoms under varied environmental conditions and monitor their osmolyte production by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy. To explore the potential of producing stress tolerant higher plants, the diatom betaine synthase will be introduced and expressed in Arabidopsis and wheat. Comprehensive training will be provided at UEA by Mock and Todd, and at JIC by Balk and Uauy.","The quaternary nitrogen compound betaine is the most abundant osmolyte on Earth.

This affects economies of scale and operating efficiency and has stopped some projects going ahead.
Applications for rule changes to the National Electricity Market (NEM) must be supported by robust evidence and data. The Investigating Local Network Charges and Local Electricity Trading project will investigate the potential impact of proposed changes on the NEM.
Five virtual trials of local network charges and local electricity trading will be conducted in NSW, VIC, and QLD to support two potential NEM rule change proposals.
Local network charges are reduced network tariffs for electricity generation used within a defined local network area. The tariff could reduce the network charge portion of electricity bills for local generators, recognising the generator is using only part of the electricity network and reflecting any long term network cost reductions.
Local electricity trading would allow generation at one site to be netted off at another site on a time-of-use basis, assigning exported generation at one site to another nearby site. This will reduce the combined energy and retail portion of electricity bills for local generation.
The Investigating Local Network Charges and Local Electricity Trading project consists of trials and studies will significantly increase industry understanding of local network charges and local electricity trading. They will establish a methodology for calculating local network charges, investigate metering requirements for local electricity trading and establish economic modelling for the benefits and impacts of both changes.
If passed, the proposed rule changes will improve opportunities for small-scale electricity generators to distribute and sell electricity locally using cost-reflective pricing arrangements. This could encourage the development of more community based renewable energy projects.

This is the case of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), an opportunistic pathogen that causes acute and chronic infections in the respiratory tract. Biofilm is characterized by cell attachment to a surface and encapsulation in self-produced extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Fundamental components of EPS for biofilm formation are extracellular DNA (eDNA), membrane vesicles (MVs) and bacterial cytosolic proteins referred as “public goods”. The mechanism of “public goods” release in the extracellular biofilm environment has not been elucidated. Recently, the Whitchurch group has found that within Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm some bacteria spontaneously undergo rapid lysis and release cellular content into the extracellular milieu; this mechanism named explosive cell lysis is critical for biofilm formation. It still needs to be verified whether explosive cell lysis accounts for “public goods” production in other bacterial species and is involved in host infection.In November 2014 I joined the Whitchurch group and obtained preliminary data indicating that this biological process occurs also for NTHi. Consequently, this project aims to investigate the importance of explosive cell lysis in biofilm formation and virulence of NTHi. Specifically, I plan to: 1- characterize “public goods” released by explosive cell lysis; 2- understand the cellular mechanisms leading to explosive cell lysis; 3- study the contribution of this phenomenon to infection of host epithelial cells.To reach this goal I will perform direct and real-time observations of bacterial biofilm using live-cell microscopy techniques including super-resolution imaging. Deciphering the mechanisms driving biofilm formation is essential to develop new approaches for broadly treating bacterial infections and fighting antibiotic resistance.","Bacteria in biofilm state increase antibiotic resistance and the ability to evade human defences, enabling them to persist in the host.

This gas is important because it is a very abundant organic sulfur compound which is released to the air from the marine environment. Globally, approximately 300 million tons of DMS per annum is produced, mainly by bacteria. Also, chemical products arising from DMS oxidation help form clouds over the oceans, to an extent that affects the sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, with effects on climate. In turn, these products are delivered back to Earth as rain, representing a key component of the global sulfur cycle. Interestingly, DMS is a potent chemo-attractant for many organisms including seabirds, crustaceans and marine mammals that all move towards DMS because they associate DMS with food.

Currently it is widely accepted that DMS is mainly produced as a result of microbes degrading the osmolyte dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), which is produced by phytoplankton in the oceans, by seaweeds and by a few salt-tolerant plants. Our preliminary work and that of Ron Kiene, has prompted us to question whether it is solely these processes that produce DMS.

In our preliminary data we have:
1. Found a microbial pathway, the methanethiol-dependent DMS production (Mdd) pathway, that produces DMS but which does not involve DMSP. 
2. Shown how the bacterium ""Pseudomonas deceptionensis"" makes DMS via a gene called mddA.
3. Shown that this gene is found in a wide range of bacteria such as Bradyrhizobium japonicum, a nitrogen-fixing symbiont of soybeans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis and some cyanobacteria. 
4. Shown that the Mdd pathway is active in both salty and freshwater sediments and that the mddA gene is abundant in bacteria living in marine sediments.
5. Shown that other bacteria have other undiscovered ways of making DMS from methanethiol.

We wish to investigate how important this novel DMS production pathway is for the global production of this climate changing gas. To answer this question, we will sample various marine and freshwater environments and investigate how active the Mdd pathway is in these environments and how this novel pathway for the production of DMS is regulated. We already know that this Mdd pathway is probably active in most of our sample sites, which include mud from a saltmarsh, a freshwater lake, a peat bog and seawater. 

It is equally important to know which microbes are responsible for the process (mediated by Mdd) and why they produce DMS. We will use a powerful suite of microbial ecology techniques, combined with genetic tools to identify the microbes and the key genes involved in producing DMS via this new Mdd pathway.

We will identify: a) the microbes living in both the oxic and anoxic mud samples and in seawater; b) how these microbial communities change when we enrich for increased DMS production via the Mdd pathway and c) which forms of the mddA gene (and the enzyme encoded by this gene) are responsible for high DMS production in these varied environments. 

To understand how and why bacteria in the environment are Mdd active, we will study in detail a few model bacteria, some of which have been isolated from our sample sites. This will involve identifying and mutating the genes encoding the Mdd pathway to ascertain why they use it. This will be done with bacteria that have a specific gene ""mddA"", but, also on those that do not, which will allow us to identify new mdd genes. 

Given the environmental consequences of the climate-active gas DMS, it is important to know which types of microbes affect its production and which of the various potential pathways are involved. This will help us in the future to model how changes in the environment impact on the balance of these climate processes.","The ""smell of the seaside"" is actually caused by a gaseous compound called dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that is produced by microbes.

3,grant.9055808,2544,Lithium-Sulfur Batteries for Large-Scale Energy Storage,Lithium-Sulfur Batteries for Large-Scale Energy Storage,"The Lithium-Sulfur Batteries for Large-Scale Energy Storage project has identified that limited cost effective energy storage technologies have hindered the progress of renewable energy industries.
With the growth of the energy storage market predicted to increase at a rate of approximately 22 per cent p.a.,[1] lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) alone cannot fulfil the growing demand and requirements of portable electronics, electric vehicles, and stationary electric energy storage.
Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery technology has the potential for high-energy density and low-cost, large-scale energy storage and conversion due to the widespread availability and low cost of sulfur. This makes Li-S a promising candidate for the next generation energy storage devices.
Advances in Li- S technology has grown significantly in recent years and a number of research organisations are devoting effort and resources to exploring potential use in numerous end products including electric vehicles, consumer devices, electronics, and gridscale energy storage.
However, there are many technical challenges facing the development of Li-S batteries including the insulating nature of sulfur (which leads to poor power density), limited cycle life, and the high reactivity of the lithium metal anode.
This project lead by the University of Technology Sydney aimed to understand the materials and cell behaviour of Li-S batteries, with a goal to develop a conceptual design, fabrication and electrochemical data evaluation of commercial size Li-S batteries.
The UTS research team along with industry partners DLG Power Battery and Korea Electrochemistry Research Institute (KERI) have already made advancements that enabled the development of demonstration and prototype Li-S batteries. This has included the assembly of a pouch-type Li-S battery. The R&D results have found these prototype Li-S batteries as superior to commercially available Li-I batteries regarding the material cost, delivered capacity and energy densities.
The project was successful in developing advanced Li-S batteries for renewable energy storage with high energy density, extended service life and operational safety. The research led to several publications in international journals and conferences, which has helped to accelerate the pace of innovation in the field of battery research.
Further improvements are required before Li-S batteries are a reliable commercial product. These improvements include addressing the limited life of Li-Sbatteries as well as the, high self-discharge and poor rate capability.
While the commercial size Li-S battery is in its early stages of development, this project has advanced the information and commercialisation prospects. Further breakthroughs and improvements in engineering science and associated techniques for the Li-S battery could be achieved in the near future. This could allow renewable energy, particularly wind and solar, to better compete with fossil fuels particularly through providing more reliable power.","The Lithium-Sulfur Batteries for Large-Scale Energy Storage project has identified that limited cost effective energy storage technologies have hindered the progress of renewable energy industries.
With the growth of the energy storage market predicted to increase at a rate of approximately 22 per cent p.a.,[1] lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) alone cannot fulfil the growing demand and requirements of portable electronics, electric vehicles, and stationary electric energy storage.
Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery technology has the potential for high-energy density and low-cost, large-scale energy storage and conversion due to the widespread availability and low cost of sulfur. This makes Li-S a promising candidate for the next generation energy storage devices.
Advances in Li- S technology has grown significantly in recent years and a number of research organisations are devoting effort and resources to exploring potential use in numerous end products including electric vehicles, consumer devices, electronics, and gridscale energy storage.
However, there are many technical challenges facing the development of Li-S batteries including the insulating nature of sulfur (which leads to poor power density), limited cycle life, and the high reactivity of the lithium metal anode.
This project lead by the University of Technology Sydney aimed to understand the materials and cell behaviour of Li-S batteries, with a goal to develop a conceptual design, fabrication and electrochemical data evaluation of commercial size Li-S batteries.
The UTS research team along with industry partners DLG Power Battery and Korea Electrochemistry Research Institute (KERI) have already made advancements that enabled the development of demonstration and prototype Li-S batteries. This has included the assembly of a pouch-type Li-S battery. The R&D results have found these prototype Li-S batteries as superior to commercially available Li-I batteries regarding the material cost, delivered capacity and energy densities.

2,grant.3865249,EP/L021005/1,New insights in quantum algorithms and complexity,New insights in quantum algorithms and complexity,"A quantum computer is a machine built to use the mysterious principles of quantum mechanics to achieve an advantage in some task over any standard (""classical"") computer. Large-scale quantum computers have not yet been built; however, an international effort is currently underway to do so. Much theoretical work has also been carried out to understand the power of quantum computation, and in particular, quantum algorithms have been developed for certain problems that outperform any possible algorithm running on a classical computer. These problems include breaking cryptographic codes (such as the RSA code which underlies Internet security), certain database search problems, and efficient simulation of quantum mechanical systems (with applications including design of medicinal compounds and novel materials).

One reason that the study of quantum computing is so fascinating is that, as well as having practical applications like this, it enables us to obtain a deeper understanding of nature. As it appears that quantum mechanics is the physical theory on which our universe is based, understanding what a quantum computer can do is nothing less than understanding the computational power of the universe.

This project aims to find a deeper understanding of what it is about certain problems which means that there is an efficient quantum algorithm to solve them. In particular, the project will develop new algorithms and protocols for quantum computers to obtain dramatic efficiency improvements over classical computation. Some of these algorithms could be tested experimentally in the near future. The proposal is divided into three themes.

The first theme will find new quantum algorithms, communication protocols and data structures. For example, super-efficient quantum algorithms will be developed for determining whether an object has some property, or is very far away from having that property. One problem of this nature would be to determine whether a computer network is connected or very far from connected, by looking at only a few, randomly chosen, links between computers. It is by now fairly well understood which problems like this have fast solutions on a classical computer. However, quantum computers might be able to achieve dramatic speed-ups for certain problems of this type. Efficient algorithms for discrete problems (e.g. concerning graphs and codes) will also be developed using the exciting new technique known as quantum walks, and finally the question of whether there exist quantum data structures which are more efficient than any classical data structure will be attacked.

In the second theme, ideas from quantum computing will be used to study the complexity of problems from quantum physics and quantum chemistry. On the one hand, new quantum algorithms will be developed that allow quantum computers to solve practically important problems from these fields more efficiently than is possible classically. On the other, intractability of certain problems in this area will be proven, which will enable practitioners (such as physicists and chemists) to determine when problems they want to solve are actually intrinsically hard. Ideas from quantum computing are thus a helpful tool even without having access to a large-scale quantum computer.

Finally, the third theme will develop new underlying mathematical technology in order to solve the difficult problems thrown up by the first two themes. These include developments in the theory of ""hypercontractivity"", which has recently been an essential tool in many important results in theoretical computer science, and new mathematical techniques to find tighter bounds on the abilities of quantum computation.

Taken together, these results will mark a significant leap forward in our understanding of the power of quantum computers.","A quantum computer is a machine built to use the mysterious principles of quantum mechanics to achieve an advantage in some task over any standard (""classical"") computer.

Hence, the contributions of this research will be twofold, i.e. conceptual and managerial. The conceptual contribution lies mainly in the analysis of the impact of SM use on innovation processes.

The managerial contribution involves identifying organizational best practices regarding SM use and highlighting the risks associated with a lack of clearly defined (or excessively restrictive) organizational SM policies.",294487,CHF,393151,1/06/2014,2014,30/09/2017,2017,Emmanuel Josserand; Pierre-Jean Barlatier; Patrick Badillo; Angela Bachetta von Beckh,University of Geneva,University of Geneva; University of Technology Sydney,grid.8591.5; grid.117476.2,Geneva; Sydney,; New South Wales,Switzerland; Australia,Swiss National Science Foundation,,Switzerland,,http://p3.snf.ch/project-149855,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5234048,"0806 Information Systems; 1503 Business and Management; 08 Information and Computing Sciences; 15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services",Behavioral and Social Science,,,,,C17 Business and Management Studies,

Decisions are often not just about scientific evidence of best practice. Rather, decisions are heavily influenced by social context and the relationships that surround them.

This research will redefine our knowledge of important marine microbial processes by coupling novel physiological and molecular tools to resolve the microscale ecological links between bacteria and phytoplankton, and will identify how the chemical interactions between these groups change under shifting environmental conditions.

2,grant.2770365,NE/J01138X/1,How do eukaryotic phytoplankton produce the most abundant organo-sulphur compound in the world's oceans?,How do eukaryotic phytoplankton produce the most abundant organo-sulphur compound in the world's oceans?,"There is a molecule, called dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) which is made in very large amounts - a billion tons per year, worldwide - by myriads of tiny single-celled marine plankton, many seaweeds and a few land plants that live near the seaside. In some of these, most of the sulphur and much of the carbon is in the form of this molecule, but the influence of DMSP is even more wide-ranging than that. Despite its abundance, there is no clear agreement as to what is the function of the DMSP - maybe it buffers the cells from the saltiness of the sea, maybe it acts as a defence compound against attack by predators, maybe it protects against ultraviolet light. - maybe it is a molecular jack of all trades.
DMSP is not only interesting in its own right, but it also has a chemical legacy, since it is the parent compound for other molecules that are also very important. When the plant-like organisms that make DMSP release it into the environment, either by leakage, or more dramatically when they are lysed by viruses or microscopic animals, it is used as a tasty food source by the teeming marine bacteria and some fungi in a process of DMSP catabolism. This represents a massive part of the global sulphur cycle, but even that is not all. 
One of the DMSP breakdown products is a gas, called dimethyl sulphide (DMS), which has important environmental impacts in its own right. Of the 300 million tons of DMS made each year in the oceans and their margins, around 10% escapes into the atmosphere, where it gets oxidised to sulphate and sulphuric acid. These molecules act as ""Cloud Condensation Nuclei"", which cause clouds to form, just as specks of dust can start crystals growing in crystal gardens. This occurs on such a scale that it is responsible for much of the cloud cover over the seas and oceans and may affect the amount of solar heat and light that arrives on Earth - a form of ""Global Dimming"". The DMS also acts as a signal for many marine animals - birds, seals and tiny crustaceans - since it is a chemical signature for their plankton food supplies. Also to us, as Homo sapiens, DMS is part of the smell of the seaside, especially when there is a lot of seaweed about.
Although there have been some nice preliminary studies in which the general pathways for DMSP synthesis have been described, none of the purified enzymes or corresponding genes have been identified in any DMSP-producing organism. This lack of knowledge has made it hard to work out unambiguously what are the true functions of DMSP.
This study focuses on one group of phytoplankton, collectively known as diatoms, which produce large amounts of DMSP. These microscopic plant-like organisms are abundant in the world's oceans - all told, they make up a quarter of Earth's plant life by weight and they produce around the same proportion of the oxygen that we breathe. 
We have very recently identified four key genes in diatoms that we strongly believe encode enzymes that are involved in DMSP production. We now plan to study the exact functions of these genes and the enzymes that they encode by making mutants that no longer make DMSP and, conversely, by engineering strains that over-produce it. This will allow us, for the first time in any organism, to figure out with certainty what are the functions of this key molecule. We will also discover how the genes are expressed; are they switched on all the time, or do they respond to (for example) various stresses in the environment? Does this differ between different species? Not only will this provide new insights on the role(s) of DMSP in diatoms, but our results should shed light on the mechanisms that are involved in this process in other important marine organisms that make this key molecule. Such studies will only strengthen our ability to assess the effects of future environmental changes on this crucial biosynthetic process.","There is a molecule, called dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) which is made in very large amounts - a billion tons per year, worldwide - by myriads of tiny single-celled marine plankton, many seaweeds and a few land plants that live near the seaside.

2,grant.2767982,G1100100,1. Identification of bacterial genes involved in antibiotic resistance using whole genome screens,1. Identification of bacterial genes involved in antibiotic resistance using whole genome screens,"Antibiotic resistance in disease-causing bacteria has spread, resulting in the inability to treat some bacterial infections, which can lead to the deaths of patients. Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics using different mechanisms, only some of which have been characterised. A better understanding of how bacteria resist antibiotic action will assist in the making of new antibiotics, may provide new ways of controlling resistance, and help us to predict when resistance to a particular antibiotic is likely to arise, allowing a pre-emptive switch to a different antibiotic for disease treatment. At the Sanger Institute, by using the latest DNA sequencing technology to analyse very large collections of bacterial mutants, we can firstly identify those components of the bacterial cell that are essential for life. These provide candidate targets for the development of new antibiotics. Secondly, we can measure every non-essential component of the bacterial cell for its contribution to antibiotic resistance. We have performed a pilot study which has shown that the method also tells us which cellular components contribute to the bacterial cells? sensitivity to antibiotics. This information tells us how it may, in the future, be possible to make resistant bacteria susceptible once again to antibiotics. It also gives us a more complete understanding of how bacteria resist antibiotics, and in general provides clues as to the role of the bacterial cell components, as the role of most components is not fully understood and the role of many is unknown. It is proposed to perform these experiments on a number of disease causing bacteria: the large mutant collections needed are already available for Salmonella Typhi which causes typhoid fever, and Salmonella Typhimurium which causes food poisoning. In addition, mutant collections will be made in MRSA (a strain of Staphylococcus aureus), Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli, all of which cause infections acquired by patients whilst in hospital, and are particularly dangerous for individuals who are already ill with other medical conditions. Many antibiotics exist, but there are relatively few different types. Using one of each type will maximise our understanding of antibiotic resistance mechanisms for significantly less effort and expense. Once the data have been generated, they will be made available, in an easy to understand form, on the Sanger Institute web site where they will provide a freely and widely available resource for researchers and any other interested parties.

Technical Summary
Antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens has spread, resulting in therapeutic failures in the treatment of some bacterial infections. A number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms are known, however, resistance is dependent on other, complementing mechanisms that have been termed ?innate resistance,? such as efflux systems which eject antibiotics from the bacterial cell. Recent work, and our proof of principle study, has identified genes not previously known to contribute to antibiotic resistance, and has indicated that other unknown resistance mechanisms exist. These numerous resistance mechanisms have been termed the bacterial ?resistome.? Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS) combines high through-put Illumina sequencing and very large pools of transposon mutant libraries to simultaneously identify the site of every transposon insertion. This firstly identifies essential gene candidates, representing approximately 10% of the genome, in which transposon mutations are absent. These essential genes indicate candidate targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. Secondly, TraDIS allows every non-essential gene, approximately 90% of the genome, to be assayed simultaneously, which has not been achievable previously. Thus, by growing the mutant pool in sub-lethal concentrations of an antibiotic, the relative contribution of each non-essential gene to tolerance or sensitivity to the antibiotic may be measured. The entire non-essential gene set may then be listed in order of genes most important for resistance, through genes of no importance to those genes whose functions contribute to sensitivity. It is proposed to perform this type of experiment using two serotypes of Salmonella for which large transposon mutant libraries are already available; Typhi, which causes typhoid fever, and Typhimurium which causes food poisoning. In addition, transposon mutant collections will be generated for a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, an E. coli strain from a case of septicaemia, and Enterobacter cloacae, all of which cause nosocomial infections, and are particularly dangerous for immunocompromised and intensive care patients. A number of different antibiotics will be tested. This potentially provides new ways of combating resistance: resistant strains may be rendered sensitive using compounds that inhibit targets involved in resistance, and by compounds that induce expression of those genes products that contribute to sensitivity. In addition, the data will provide clues as to which resistance mechanisms may be operating in strains where the mechanism has not been identified. All the data will be made available on the Sanger Institute web site and will provide a useful resource for researchers engaged in antibiotic research and development.","Antibiotic resistance in disease-causing bacteria has spread, resulting in the inability to treat some bacterial infections, which can lead to the deaths of patients. Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics using different mechanisms, only some of which have been characterised. A better understanding of how bacteria resist antibiotic action will assist in the making of new antibiotics, may provide new ways of controlling resistance, and help us to predict when resistance to a particular antibiotic is likely to arise, allowing a pre-emptive switch to a different antibiotic for disease treatment. At the Sanger Institute, by using the latest DNA sequencing technology to analyse very large collections of bacterial mutants, we can firstly identify those components of the bacterial cell that are essential for life. These provide candidate targets for the development of new antibiotics. Secondly, we can measure every non-essential component of the bacterial cell for its contribution to antibiotic resistance. We have performed a pilot study which has shown that the method also tells us which cellular components contribute to the bacterial cells? sensitivity to antibiotics. This information tells us how it may, in the future, be possible to make resistant bacteria susceptible once again to antibiotics. It also gives us a more complete understanding of how bacteria resist antibiotics, and in general provides clues as to the role of the bacterial cell components, as the role of most components is not fully understood and the role of many is unknown. It is proposed to perform these experiments on a number of disease causing bacteria: the large mutant collections needed are already available for Salmonella Typhi which causes typhoid fever, and Salmonella Typhimurium which causes food poisoning. In addition, mutant collections will be made in MRSA (a strain of Staphylococcus aureus), Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli, all of which cause infections acquired by patients whilst in hospital, and are particularly dangerous for individuals who are already ill with other medical conditions. Many antibiotics exist, but there are relatively few different types. Using one of each type will maximise our understanding of antibiotic resistance mechanisms for significantly less effort and expense. Once the data have been generated, they will be made available, in an easy to understand form, on the Sanger Institute web site where they will provide a freely and widely available resource for researchers and any other interested parties.

Technical Summary
Antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens has spread, resulting in therapeutic failures in the treatment of some bacterial infections. A number of antibiotic resistance mechanisms are known, however, resistance is dependent on other, complementing mechanisms that have been termed ?innate resistance,? such as efflux systems which eject antibiotics from the bacterial cell. Recent work, and our proof of principle study, has identified genes not previously known to contribute to antibiotic resistance, and has indicated that other unknown resistance mechanisms exist. These numerous resistance mechanisms have been termed the bacterial ?resistome.? Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS) combines high through-put Illumina sequencing and very large pools of transposon mutant libraries to simultaneously identify the site of every transposon insertion. This firstly identifies essential gene candidates, representing approximately 10% of the genome, in which transposon mutations are absent. These essential genes indicate candidate targets for the development of new antibacterial agents. Secondly, TraDIS allows every non-essential gene, approximately 90% of the genome, to be assayed simultaneously, which has not been achievable previously. Thus, by growing the mutant pool in sub-lethal concentrations of an antibiotic, the relative contribution of each non-essential gene to tolerance or sensitivity to the antibiotic may be measured. The entire non-essential gene set may then be listed in order of genes most important for resistance, through genes of no importance to those genes whose functions contribute to sensitivity.

Technical Summary
BACKGROUND: 
Cryptococcal meningitis is an urgent global health problem. The goal of induction antifungal therapy is to achieve rapid fungal killing because this is associated with improved clinical outcomes. In the UK this is usually achieved with 2-weeks of i.v. amphotericin B deoxycholate?flucytosine. In much of the developing world there are inadequate resources to enable prolonged administration of i.v. drugs or the detection and management of drug-related toxicity. The inability to give i.v. induction therapy is a significant therapeutic obstacle. Importantly, however, the use of shorter induction regimens that still achieve rapid fungicidal activity would facilitate the administration of optimal antifungal therapy in resource poor settings. This research will use well-validated experimental models of cryptococcal meningitis and state-of-the-art mathematical modelling techniques to identify candidate antifungal regimens for resource-poor settings. These regimens can then be immediately expedited for study in clinical trials.
AIMS:
Aim #1. Identify novel induction regimens of amphotericin B deoxycholate that result in the same or better fungicidal activity as 0.7 mg/kg/day administered to humans for 14 days 
Aim #II. Define the optimal dosage, schedule of administration and shortest duration of therapy of lipid preparations of amphotericin B that results in near maximal fungicidal activity
Aim #III. Define optimal combination regimens and the shortest duration of therapy that results in the same or better fungicidal activity as standard antifungal combinations administered for 14 days

METHODS: A well-validated murine model of cryptococcal meningitis will be used. The biomarker will be the fungal density in the brain. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships will be elucidated by studying a range of clinically relevant regimens. Mathematical models that describe the time-course of drug concentrations (in serum and brain) and the associated antifungal effect will be fitted to each dataset. These mathematical models will be used to humanise the mouse in silico (i.e. in a simulator, drug will be given to a virtual mouse to generate a human-like concentration-time profile). The predicted antifungal effect resulting from these innovative regimens will be determined. Key findings will be further validated in a rabbit model of cryptococcal meningitis. 
SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL OPPORTUNITIES: This research will deliver: (1) new induction regimens for amphotericin B deoxycholate; (2) new induction regimens for lipid preparations of amphotericin B; and (3) new induction antifungal combination regimens. This proposal offers the real possibility to deliver a step change in the management of cryptococcal meningitis for the developing world.","Cryptococcal meningitis is a frequently lethal fungal infection of the lining of the brain.

We also discovered a novel intronic promoter that is potentially regulated by Progesterone Receptor and could allow independent regulation of expression of the p68 miRNA.The proposed project aims to (i) investigate how expression of the p68 miRNA is regulated, with particular reference to the intronic promoter; (ii) explore the role of the p68 miRNA in cellular apoptosis and invasion; and (iii) identify targets of this miRNA with a view to understanding the mechanism by which it could contribute towards breast cancer progression",163205,GBP,260806,1/05/2011,2011,30/04/2014,2014,Frances Fuller-Pace; A P South; Gyorgy Hutvagner; Simak Ali,University of Dundee,University of Dundee; University of Technology Sydney; Imperial College London,grid.8241.f; grid.117476.2; grid.7445.2,Dundee; Sydney; London,; New South Wales; Westminster,United Kingdom; Australia; United Kingdom,Breast Cancer Now,AMRC; ICRP,United Kingdom,pub.1033047338; pub.1072297592; pub.1047811182; pub.1016368614; pub.1091132073; pub.1032349114; pub.1072310075; pub.1042747954; pub.1027813702,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.5137542,1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis; 0601 Biochemistry and Cell Biology; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 06 Biological Sciences,Cancer; Breast Cancer; Biotechnology; Genetics; Prevention,Cancer,,Breast Cancer,1.4 Cancer Progression and Metastasis; 1.3 Cancer Initiation: Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes,A01 Clinical Medicine,
3,grant.4900450,N/A,A microfabricated coral to unravel the microbial ecology of coral disease,A microfabricated coral to unravel the microbial ecology of coral disease,"Coral reefs are ecologically and economically important marine ecosystems that are currently under threat as a consequence of environmental degradation, global climate change and emerging diseases. An important element in determining the health of corals is the stability and function of the coral 'holobiont', the complex and diverse community of microorganisms living in partnership with the coral host. Shifts in the balance of the holobiont community composition can lead to coral disease and bleaching. However, studying the mechanisms behind these shifts is hindered by the physical and biochemical complexities of the coral holobiont. To overcome these obstacles we will for the first time apply microfluidic technology to create a ""Microfabricated Coral Holobiont"" (MCH). This simulated microenvironment will replicate the key physical, chemical and biological features of the coral holobiont and will represent a powerful new experimental platform to study the ecology of the coral holobiont within a controlled setting in the laboratory. We will couple this system with videomicroscopic measurements of microbial behavior and a suite of specific cell stress response probes to examine the hypothesis that specific chemical cues produced by different members of the coral holobiont can favor or impede the colonization of pathogenic bacteria involved in coral disease. We will use a second novel microfluidic-based tool, the ""In Situ Chemotaxis Assay"" (ISCA), to investigate the chemical ecology of natural coral-associated microbial communities within two important coral reef ecosystems, the Great Barrier Reef (Australia) and the Red Sea (Eilat, Israel). Coupled with modern molecular tools (metagenomics), the ISCA will allow for the first in situ measurement of microbial behavioral responses to chemical cues released by different compartments of the holobiont. The interdisciplinary research team is uniquely positioned to tackle this challenge, as it brings together expertise in nanotechnology, engineering, fluid dynamics, biochemistry, molecular biology, microbial and chemical ecology and oceanography. The new approach proposed here will deliver novel insights into the cellular mechanisms behind coral disease, which will ultimately aid in the management of coral reefs and in the preservation of their ecological, economic and societal value.","Coral reefs are ecologically and economically important marine ecosystems that are currently under threat as a consequence of environmental degradation, global climate change and emerging diseases.

Core Programme Support 2011-2015 and Core programme support 2014-2019,"For over 20 years Children of the 90s (or ALSPAC) has charted the health of 14,500 parents and
children. Now in its third decade it has started to study the next generation, the children of the
Children of the 90s. The study is unequalled by other population studies because of the breadth
and depth of information it holds on participants from before birth over 20 years ago through to the
present day. It is internationally renowned and used by researchers worldwide. The data allow
researchers to study key periods of development, how certain conditions develop and change over
time and are passed (or not) from one generation to the next, and how health is affected by the
interplay between genes and other factors like smoking, where people live and the job they do.
Our goals are to ensure the resource remains sustainable and open to researchers to use, and
that participants remain engaged. We will continue to gather information from the original children
through clinical assessments, questionnaires and record linkage, and will be recruiting and
gathering data on the children of the children as well as merging genetic data and enhancing research in the exciting new field of epigenomics.

Technical Summary
The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) is a prospective cohort study with
unprecedented scope and detail of information on thousands of people from before birth through
to early adulthood, on their parents and now on their children. It is an internationally valued
resource at the forefront of population-based research. ALSPAC allows the investigation of
developmental trajectories marking critical periods in human life, the genetic and epigenetic
factors contributing to health and disease and the environmental exposures which form the context
within which these processes act. As ALSPAC participants enter adulthood and start having
children, the study's potential to contribute to scientific discovery is expanding, giving a greater
capacity to explore links between current and future health and the intergenerational components
of health and disease. ALSPAC is unequivocally the richest open-access epidemiological resource
in the world. Our goals are to ensure that ALSPAC (i) is sustained, (ii) has participation maximised
and (iii) is enhanced. These goals will be delivered by follow-up of the original cohort through clinic
assessment, questionnaires and record linkage, data collection on their children, consolidation of
GWAS data on all participants and the development of epigenomics research.","For over 20 years Children of the 90s (or ALSPAC) has charted the health of 14,500 parents and

2,grant.2782339,EP/I011587/1,HUMAN-AGENT COLLECTIVES: FROM FOUNDATIONS TO APPLICATIONS [ORCHID],HUMAN-AGENT COLLECTIVES: FROM FOUNDATIONS TO APPLICATIONS [ORCHID],"With a reported 5 billion mobile subscriptions worldwide, access to communication technologies has reached unprecedented levels and has fundamentally altered the ways in which we experience computational systems. Once delivered through a desktop machine to an office worker, computing has become an interwoven feature of everyday life across the globe in a way that profoundly affects us all. We are now interconnected using mobile devices; we routinely invoke remote services through a global cloud infrastructure and increasingly rely on computational devices in our everyday life. Computational devices monitor our health, entertain us, guide us and keep us safe and secure. However, this explosive growth in these devices and on-line services is only a precursor to an era of ubiquity, where each of us will routinely rely upon a plethora of smart and proactive computers that we carry with us, access at home and at work, and that are embedded into the world around us. As computation increasingly pervades the world around us, it will profoundly change the ways in which we work with computers. Rather than issuing instructions to passive machines, we will increasingly work in partnership with highly inter-connected computational components (aka agents) that are able to act autonomously and intelligently. Specifically, humans and software agents will continually and flexibly establish a range of collaborative relationships with one another, forming human-agent collectives (HACs) to meet their individual and collective goals. This vision of people and computational agents operating at a global scale offers tremendous potential and, if realised correctly, will help us meet the key societal challenges of sustainability, inclusion, and safety that are core to our future. However, these benefits are mirrored by the potential of equally concerning pitfalls as we shift to becoming increasingly dependent on systems that interweave human and computational endeavour.As systems based on human-agent collectives grow in scale, complexity and temporal extent, we will increasingly require a principled science that allows us to reason about the computational and human aspects of these systems if we are to avoid developments that are unsafe, unreliable and lack the appropriate safeguards to ensure societal acceptance.Delivering this science is the core research objective of this Programme. In more detail, it seeks to establish the new science that is needed to understand, build and apply HACs that symbiotically interleave human and computer systems to an unprecedented degree. To this end, it brings together three world-leading academic groups from the Universities of Southampton, Oxford and Nottingham (with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of artificial intelligence, agent-based computing, machine learning, decentralised information systems, participatory systems, and ubiquitous computing) with industrial collaborators (initially BAE Systems, PRI Ltd and the Australian Centre for Field Robotics) to collectively establish the foundational scientific underpinnings of these systems and drive these understandings to real-world applications in the critical domains of future energy networks, and disaster response.","With a reported 5 billion mobile subscriptions worldwide, access to communication technologies has reached unprecedented levels and has fundamentally altered the ways in which we experience computational systems.

To this end, it brings together three world-leading academic groups from the Universities of Southampton, Oxford and Nottingham (with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of artificial intelligence, agent-based computing, machine learning, decentralised information systems, participatory systems, and ubiquitous computing) with industrial collaborators (initially BAE Systems, PRI Ltd and the Australian Centre for Field Robotics) to collectively establish the foundational scientific underpinnings of these systems and drive these understandings to real-world applications in the critical domains of future energy networks, and disaster response.",5537002,GBP,8602589,1/01/2011,2011,29/06/2016,2016,Nick Jennings; Thomas Rodden; Stephen Roberts; Sarvapali Dyanand Ramchurn; Luc Moreau,University of Southampton,University of Southampton; BAE Systems (United Kingdom); University of Technology Sydney; University of Sydney,grid.5491.9; grid.1343.5; grid.117476.2; grid.1013.3,Southampton; London; Sydney; Sydney,; ; New South Wales; New South Wales,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Australia; Australia,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,cOAlition S; UKRI,United Kingdom,pub.1052023938; pub.1037503091; pub.1014729406; pub.1038070245; pub.1007543519; pub.1017721086; pub.1051837628; pub.1027917600; pub.1006373455; pub.1029325349; pub.1040932762; pub.1045164763; pub.1059480627; pub.1016014002; pub.1007947611; pub.1059918032; pub.1124016320; pub.1039502420; pub.1013896284; pub.1032826357; pub.1061658872; pub.1003422398; pub.1011131054; pub.1034351828; pub.1027147946; pub.1030012871; pub.1024817169; pub.1103568716; pub.1038767871; pub.1011283195; pub.1005776008; pub.1052473034; pub.1045416421; pub.1025937698; pub.1020860106; pub.1025564431; pub.1052932776; pub.1105689856; pub.1048312511; pub.1101036542; pub.1061786590; pub.1020091583; pub.1040138289; pub.1019641068; pub.1110842146; pub.1043244569; pub.1084010778; pub.1094729581; pub.1033603211; pub.1025755005; pub.1043398936; pub.1056916047; pub.1050417369; pub.1095424263; pub.1031168497; pub.1035433929; pub.1034484274; pub.1043758415; pub.1092535282; pub.1005424407; pub.1021678653; pub.1059915294; pub.1059922801; pub.1059916671; pub.1061430938; pub.1038254015; pub.1025822540; pub.1023148973; pub.1061580176; pub.1014814779; pub.1100109843; pub.1027834617; pub.1025337461; pub.1049877853; pub.1030238478; pub.1059916546; pub.1037813123; pub.1032363429; pub.1018301283; pub.1040437487; pub.1059917732; pub.1002837447; pub.1021160865; pub.1045272515; pub.1060742032; pub.1013971409; pub.1011736763; pub.1093866447; pub.1091230134; pub.1001578168; pub.1083865149; pub.1006448351; pub.1061388754; pub.1040776693; pub.1048246674,https://gtr.ukri.org/project/E200D524-27CD-4675-B743-4B1DF537E1C6,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.2782339,0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing; 0803 Computer Software; 0802 Computation Theory and Mathematics; 0806 Information Systems; 08 Information and Computing Sciences; 08 Information and Computing Sciences; 08 Information and Computing Sciences; 08 Information and Computing Sciences,,Generic Health Relevance,,,,B11 Computer Science and Informatics,

However, the emergence of a new generation of social, pervasive and affective ICT promises to transform the creative landscape, raising major new challenges for both the creative industries and ICT research. This cluster therefore seeks to answer two closely related questions: what key challenges face the creative industries due to the emergence of a new generation of social, pervasive and affective ICT? and conversely, what long term challenges must be tackled by ICT research in order to support future creative industries?In answering these questions we also recognise that the creative industries have a distinctive character that challenges traditional models of research and business innovation. Specifically, the creative industries revolve around dynamic and often unorthodox coalitions, whereby numerous small and micro-businesses come together for the duration of a single project, then disband and form new partnerships for the next project. Unlike larger companies, it can be extremely challenging to engage such dynamic creative networks in traditional long-term term EPSRC-funded research projects.

It continues the work done inmy Ph.D. Thesis on the impact of the business context on business collaboration models, choreography languages,and business documents. This thesis extended the concepts of the modeling methodology of the United Nation'sCentre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) called UMM. In the meanwhile the proposedextensions have been included into the newest version of UMM of which I am a co-editor. In our research groupwe have developed a plug-in to a commercial UML tool that fully supports the UML profile defined by UMM.This tool is recommended in the Australian e-government framework GovDex.The UMM is used to model an inter-organizational business process concentrating on the flow of interactionsbetween collaborating business partners and not on their private processes. The resulting choreography is describedfrom a global view. This means that a single model describes the interactions of all parties. This is appropriate todevelop so-called industry reference models or standard models. However, an enterprise usually prefers describingthe flow of process interactions with their partners from its local view. This means that each partner in a businesscollaboration has its own model that differs from the partners' ones, but that must be complementary to thepartners' ones. A simple example of complementary flows is if one partner performs an invoke activity the otherone must perform a receive activity. If each partner develops its local choreography in isolation it is very unlikelythat partners will interoperate or in other words they will not be able to do business electronically. Since this is thecase in most current approaches, we do not see process interoperability crossing the borders of enterprises.An alternative approach is considering the specifications of a public choreography when constructing the localchoreography. The project proposal is based on this paradigm. It focuses on the analysis and design in adevelopment process for inter-organizational business systems. In the project we use UML to denote the analysisand design artefacts. The definition of a local choreography must handle interactions with multiple parties. Theglobal choreography of UMM models defines binary collaborations, i.e. between two partners only. Consequently,a local choreography will span over multiple global choreographies. Each interaction of a local choreography mustconsider the targets of a single interaction in the global choreography. Furthermore, the local choreography mustkeep the flow - as defined in the global choreography - for each binary partnership that is part of the multipartyprocess. There are approaches to automatically transform global choreographies to local ones. However, they arenot appropriate for two reasons. Firstly, the UMM activities are less granular than what is needed in the localchoreography and secondly the number of parties in the UMM models which is exactly two, does not necessarilymatch the number of parties in the local choreography.The goal of the project is the support of the analysis and design of local choreographies. It will deliver a UMLprofile for modeling local choreographies. This profile and its constraints are attuned to the ones of UMM in orderto automatically check compliance of local and global choreographies. It is envisioned to collect appropriate globalchoreographies and parts thereof, to semi-automatically transform these into local representation and to mergethem consistently into multi-party local choreographies. This also requires business-context specific registrationmechanisms to store and access artefacts of global choreographies. Of course, the software development processdoes not stop at the UML models. Hence, another aspect of the project is the transformation of the models toXML-based choreography languages which are used in service oriented solutions by applications in order tomonitor and/or execute the process.","The proposed project focuses on the support of Business-to-Business e-Commerce.

However, some critical issues remain open: improvement of water quality, enhancement of the recovery factor, reduction of the unit water cost, minimizing the brine disposal impact. With the aim to solve these problems, an innovative approach based on the integration of different membrane operations in pre-treatment and post-treatment stages is proposed.

Expected outcomes and contributions of the research are:
i) the development of advanced analytical methods for feed water characterization, appropriate fouling indicators and prediction tools, procedures and protocols at full-scale desalination facilities;
ii) identification of optimal seawater pre-treatment strategies by designing advanced hybrid membrane processes (submerged hollow fibre filtration/reaction, adsorption/ion exchange/ozonation) and comparison with conventional methods;
iii) the optimisation of RO membrane module configuration, cleaning strategies, reduction of scaling potential by NF;
iv) the development of strategies aiming to approach the concept of Zero Liquid Discharge (increasing the water recovery factor up to 95% by using Membrane Distillation - MD; bringing concentrates to solids by Membrane Crystallization or Wind Intensified Enhanced Evaporation) and to reduce the brine disposal environmental impact and cost;
v) increase the sustainability of desalination process by reducing energy consumption(evaluation of MD, demonstration of a new energy recovery device for SWRO installations)and u se of renewable energy (wind and solar).

The research team embodies science and engineering from both the practitioner and academic perspectives. Potential end-users and participating utilities will be involved in research activities and applications.

It is used by the Australian government in deciding which medical services and pharmaceuticals should be funded. This requires measurement of quality of life in a way that allows comparison across treatments, and a means of quantifying community preferences for different health states (that is, how we value health outcomes). Health outcomes are often valued using the quality adjusted life year (QALY) which combines length and quality of life in a single measure. To compare across diseases and treatments, quality of life must be measured in the same way. This can be done by using a standard set of questions that cover the different aspects of quality of life (eg pain, mobility, emotional state). In this way, a single survey instrument can be used for any disease or outcome of treatment. We can also use the same instrument to ask members of the public to provide information about their preferences for different health states (that is how they value health outcomes). However, obtaining this information from respondents is complex, and there is debate about which are the best instruments, and the best methods to value health outcomes.

The research will also provide valuations of health states from the Australian population that can then be used in economic evaluation.",450369,AUD,450369,1/01/2006,2006,31/12/2008,2008,Rosalie Viney; Julie Ratcliffe; Deborah Street; John Brazier; Madeleine King,University of Technology Sydney,University of Technology Sydney,grid.117476.2,Sydney,New South Wales,Australia,National Health and Medical Research Council,,Australia,pub.1027062687; pub.1004916959; pub.1020765922,http://purl.org/au-research/grants/nhmrc/403303,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.6729301,1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,Basic Behavioral and Social Science; Behavioral and Social Science; Clinical Research; Health Services; Pain Research; Comparative Effectiveness Research,Generic Health Relevance,8.4 Research design and methodologies; 8.2 Health and welfare economics,,,"A02 Public Health, Health Services and Primary Care",

The problems of the chronic complications of diabetes and the lack of donor tissue for transplantation, could theoretically be overcome by engineering from the patient's own cells, an artificial beta cell, i. e. a non-islet cell capable of synthesising, storing and secreting mature insulin in response to metabolic stimuli, such as glucose. The ultimate goal of this technology is to deliver the insulin gene directly to a patient's own liver cells which would regulate insulin secretion in response to glucose and other substances that stimulate insulin secretion, controlling blood glucose without the need for immunosuppression. To accomplish this it must be possible to deliver the insulin gene efficiently to primary liver cells (cells derived from an animal's or human's body). Results from our laboratory using a non-pathogenic viral delivery system indicate that we can reverse diabetes in chemically induced diabetic rats by expression of insulin and a beta cell transcription factor NeuroD. The aim of this study is to repeat this in an auto-immune model of diabetes the nonobese diabetic mouse, which mimicks very closely the development of diabetes in humans. We will determine if we can reverse diabetes in these animals and determine if their response to glucose is normal over an extended period of time, with no attack by the factors of the immune system that stimulate the development of diabetes in man. The results from this research proposal should result in the delivery of the insulin gene to large numbers of primary liver cells that will then synthesise, store and secrete insulin in response to glucose.

3,grant.6716591,352912,Recruitment and activation of alternatively activated macrophages by thioredoxin peroxidases in helminth infections,Recruitment and activation of alternatively activated macrophages by thioredoxin peroxidases in helminth infections,"This research will unlock the immunological steps that lead to the development of pathological consequences associated with infectious pathogens and human diseases. The investigation proposed is very timely, as there is a rapid growth in people acquiring infectious diseases in the developing world and inflammatory pathologies in the developed world such as artherosclerosis, asthma, and tumour progression. There is a common denominator between all of these diseases. The body loses its ability to regulate a particular type of immune response, termed Th2. This results in the production of a chronic inflammation, which causes lasting damage. We have previously pinpointed the activity of a particular type of white blood cell, the macrophage, as pivotal to the induction of the Th2 immune response. We have also identified a molecule, thioredoxin peroxidase (TPx) that triggers the macrophage to switch on Th2 responses. Once the TPx comes into contact with the surface of the macrophage cell, a series of proteins, called transcription factors become activated in a controlled cascade. This leads to the secretion of substances from the macrophage, which signal the development of Th2. We will identify the mechanism that TPx uses to initiate the process. We propose to investigate this sequence of events by using an in-vitro cell based model to study the enzymatic steps as the macrophage responds to TPx. This goal represents much more than scientific curiosity. A better understanding of the process may reveal how TPx switches on the macrophage. If the trigger for this could be found, it would present a new way to manipulate the macrophage. This will possibly unearth new drug targets and lead to more effective therapeutics against infectious diseases, asthma, artherosclerosis and cancer.","This research will unlock the immunological steps that lead to the development of pathological consequences associated with infectious pathogens and human diseases.

These issues include quality of life, care at the end of life, the funding of long term care, the use of informal carers, rationing and some work on specific conditions including prostate cancer. ||The methodological work of the programme is about making sure that these numerical estimates are based on peoples own views about what is important to them (rather than the views of experts) and that the numerical estimates obtained are accurate representations of peoples views.

Technical Summary
Across the world, the proportions of older people and the very old, (aged 85 and over), in the population are rising. These very old, particularly, are likely to have greater health problems and to receive more health and social services. Resource allocation decisions in the UK are focused on the use of the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at national level (and are still largely historically based at local level), but QALYs are problematic for making resource allocation decisions about care for older people because they are entirely health focused (where older people often require a combination of health and social care), they are concerned only with quality of life (where quality of death and dying may also be important); and they are unable to inform organisational issues (including provision of long-term care and informal care). Stated Preference Discrete Choice Modelling potentially offers a means of providing information about preferences with respect to these wider issues.||The focus of this programme is twofold - comprising a topic focus on decisions about care for older people and a methodological focus on the use of Stated Preference Discrete Choice Modelling (SPDCM). The two aspects of the programme move forward in tandem, with individual studies informing SPDCM methodology for future studies, and the particular SPDCM experiments providing information for policy decisions about care for older people. ||Specific topics included within the programme are: developing utility values for quality of life measurement, advancing the area by use of Sens capability theory; estimating preferences for informal care; determining preferences for death, dying and end of life care; assessing choices for funding of long-term care; estimating preferences for priority setting for care for older people; and work around conditions affecting older people including prostate cancer.||The innovative methodological focus of this programme is the use and development of best-worst scaling as a means of discrete choice modelling. Work is focused on a number of areas: study design and analysis using best-worst scaling; the development of attributes using rigorous methods (including in-depth interviews, meta-ethnography); optimising response (by a series of nested RCTs); determining appropriate sample sizes (using simulations to develop guidance); individual level preferences (combining complex statistical techniques and qualitative work); ordering effects (using nested RCTs); and data synthesis issues (using simulation and think aloud techniques to determine whether information from best-worst scaling can be combined with traditional SPDCM techniques).","This programme aims to provide numerical estimates of peoples preferences for a variety of issues that are important in making policy decisions about care for older people.

Stated Preference Discrete Choice Modelling potentially offers a means of providing information about preferences with respect to these wider issues.||The focus of this programme is twofold - comprising a topic focus on decisions about care for older people and a methodological focus on the use of Stated Preference Discrete Choice Modelling (SPDCM). The two aspects of the programme move forward in tandem, with individual studies informing SPDCM methodology for future studies, and the particular SPDCM experiments providing information for policy decisions about care for older people. ||Specific topics included within the programme are: developing utility values for quality of life measurement, advancing the area by use of Sens capability theory; estimating preferences for informal care; determining preferences for death, dying and end of life care; assessing choices for funding of long-term care; estimating preferences for priority setting for care for older people; and work around conditions affecting older people including prostate cancer.||The innovative methodological focus of this programme is the use and development of best-worst scaling as a means of discrete choice modelling. Work is focused on a number of areas: study design and analysis using best-worst scaling; the development of attributes using rigorous methods (including in-depth interviews, meta-ethnography); optimising response (by a series of nested RCTs); determining appropriate sample sizes (using simulations to develop guidance); individual level preferences (combining complex statistical techniques and qualitative work); ordering effects (using nested RCTs); and data synthesis issues (using simulation and think aloud techniques to determine whether information from best-worst scaling can be combined with traditional SPDCM techniques).",94766,GBP,235938,31/03/2004,2004,30/03/2007,2007,Joanna Coast,MRC Health Services Resrch Collaboration,University of Glasgow; University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; Newcastle University; University of Technology Sydney; University of Bristol,grid.8756.c; grid.410421.2; grid.8991.9; grid.1006.7; grid.117476.2; grid.5337.2,Glasgow; Bristol; London; Newcastle upon Tyne; Sydney; Bristol,; ; Camden; ; New South Wales; ,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; Australia; United Kingdom,Medical Research Council,cOAlition S; ICRP; UKRI,United Kingdom,pub.1006565089; pub.1023365686; pub.1015162007; pub.1005104416; pub.1045339479; pub.1001043820; pub.1014327514; pub.1032564211; pub.1005129525; pub.1014818648; pub.1050635131; pub.1033615203; pub.1068845050; pub.1014518884; pub.1036933671; pub.1039330476; pub.1048690509; pub.1050374020; pub.1003074629; pub.1025982271; pub.1014117241; pub.1035545402; pub.1012006650; pub.1018164488; pub.1032482917; pub.1010175139,https://gtr.ukri.org/project/C88FD9D2-17EC-4381-8327-A3FE2F1E91E1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.2778186,1402 Applied Economics; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 14 Economics; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,Health Services; Clinical Research; Aging,Generic Health Relevance,8.4 Research design and methodologies; 7.2 End of life care,Not Site-Specific Cancer,6.4 Cost Analyses and Health Care Delivery,"A02 Public Health, Health Services and Primary Care; A03 Allied Health Professions, Dentistry, Nursing and Pharmacy",

Within the ""24 hour society"" people tend more and more to exchange sleep and serenity for gain or pleasure. This gradually leads to an excessive rate of sleep disorders, roughly 20% of the population suffer from one, at least mildly or temporarily, as well as to a boom of stress and anxiety related diseases. In addition, a significant percentage of severe traffic and industrial accidents seem to be caused by the involuntary human transition from wakefulness to sleep or by prolonged inattention. SENSATION aims to explore a wide range of micro and nano sensor technologies, with the aim to achieve unobtrusive, cost-effective, real-time monitoring, detection and prediction of human physiological state in relation to wakefulness, fatigue and stress anytime, everywhere and for everybody.

Thus, the different states of human brain are analysed within SubProjectl. Big databases with recordings of normal and involuntary (during task-execution) transition from wakefulness to sleep from hundreds of people will be created to serve as development and reference basis. In Subproject 2, 17 micro sensors and 2 nano sensors are developed. They include brain monitoring, wearable, eye-related posture and motility and autonomic functions sensors; all wirelessly integrated through a body/local/wide area network. These sensors are combined into medical systems for medical diagnosis and treatment within Subproject 3. They will be also integrated in a system for operator's hypo-vigilance detection and prediction, to be used in various industrial operations and environments within Subproject 4.

The overall IP is coordinated by a series of cross-project activities within Subproject 5, which cover management, training, system architecture, dissemination, evaluation, exploitation, user awareness enhancement, standardisation, ethical and legal issues.","Sleep loss, excessive fatigue, stress and inattention constitute the social diseases of our century.

3,grant.6733159,117102,Population Dynamics and Evolution of Mosquitoes that Transmit Malaria,Population Dynamics and Evolution of Mosquitoes that Transmit Malaria,"Population dynamics and evolutionary process are fundamental to mosquito-borne infectious diseases as evolutionary forces steer both mosquito and malaria parasite to evolve around obstacles in their natural development. Environmental and ecological factors also influence the relationship between mosquito, parasite and humans. Therefore control of mosquito borne disease depends on an innate understanding of the genetics, behavior and environment. Thus studies on mosquito population dynamics including population densities, migration, population subdivisions and competition for resources will allow an understanding of these relationships. Island populations of malaria transmitting mosquitoes contain less genetic complexity (genetic variation in mosquito subpopulations) than mainland populations. Thus mosquito island populations may not contain the genetic capability of evolving around detrimental selection pressures such as the use of insecticides or predators. Armed with accurate knowledge of genetic complexity, biology and behavior of mosquito disease vector species, control measures can be accurately focused at specific populations (high disease transmission mosquito populations). This project we will identify specific populations of mosquitoes using their DNA to reveal genetic markers for specific behavior traits. Due to the smaller amount of genetic variations that island mosquito populations contain, and our aquired knowledge of their behavior and biology. We will design focused mosquito control strategies with knowledge that the mosquitoes will have a smaller chance of evolving around these control measures.","Population dynamics and evolutionary process are fundamental to mosquito-borne infectious diseases as evolutionary forces steer both mosquito and malaria parasite to evolve around obstacles in their natural development.

3,grant.3729400,FP4_21926,High performance protocol architecture,High performance protocol architecture,"HIPPARCH aims at investigating novel architectures for high performance communication protocols based on the Application Level Framing (ALF) and Integrated Layer Processing (ILP) concepts \cite{alf}.
The expected main results are:

- A protocol compiler to be made available to partners, other research groups, and industry.
- Specific control algorithms for unicast, multicast and ""network conscious applications""' mixing real-time and non real-time convential data transfers.
- An execution environment which supports real-time protocol implementations.

A relevant multimedia application consisting of architecturally enhanced WWW client and server will be developed to demonstrate the project results. The application will show the viability of the compiler and the performance of the adaptive protocols and control algorithms. The application and the protocols will be used over heterogeneous high speed, mobile and wireless networks.

The project results will be distributed to and actively discussed with standardisation bodies by project members or supporting industry participants for future standard protocols and architectures.
In a nutshell, ALF states that applications should organise the data they are sending as a sequence of autonomous ``frames'', which will be at the same time the unit of transmission, the unit of control and the unit of processing. This allows for efficient design of application specific protocols since each frame is self contained. It also enables the integration of layers, ILP, for more efficient processing. With ILP, the number of time consuming references to primary memory in modern fast processors can be reduced by integrating data manipulation functions into one or a few loops.

ALF will enable efficient design of application specific protocols for heterogeneous networks (like the Internet), integrating controls tuned to the applications needs and adaptation algorithms for the best utilisation of available network resources.

In the HIPPARCH LTR project we propose to extend the research initiated with HIPPARCH EC-AUS activity (where ALF based designed has been validated) to the broadest possible range of information services and applications. We will study the benefit of the ALF and ILP principles for the design of communication systems supporting multicast, mobility, and real-time media.","HIPPARCH aims at investigating novel architectures for high performance communication protocols based on the Application Level Framing (ALF) and Integrated Layer Processing (ILP) concepts \cite{alf}.

2,grant.9303751,MME01-0906-190024,Hydrogel Agriculture to Support Food Security in Qatar,Hydrogel Agriculture to Support Food Security in Qatar,"The state of Qatar suffers from extreme drought and arid climate conditions that limits the agricultural activities in the country. The country relies significantly on imported food products to cover the local market needs. Qatarâ  s reliance on foreign suppliers for food supply jeopardizes its long-term food security plans, economy and social growth, which are developing rapidly. Nevertheless, Qatar has the potential to address technical food challenges by applying new technologies in farming industries. One of the major hurdles that faces the development of a sustainable farming industry in Qatar is the lack of fertile soil and freshwater. This proposal aims to introduce a fertile soil for greenhouse plantations that is able to withstand the harsh environmental conditions of Qatar. The suggested soil should be able to provide nutrients to plants and reduces water wastage through evaporation and percolation. This will be achieved without adding substances of toxic natures and/or chemical fertilizers into the soil, thus keeping a natural environment for plant growth.  
The current project introduces hydrogel agriculture for greenhouse farming in Qatar. Compost soil contains the required nutrients for the growth of plants. Compost soil is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium but it has low retention for water. Laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that hydrogel is a smart technique that could provide a water reservoir in soil that can be tapped into by plants in hot climate areas. Hydrogel helps to grow more food while using less water by mixing with the soil to capture the irrigation water near the plant; this will help the plants to grow more steadily overtime. The hydrogel materials are superabsorbent polymers prepared from acrylic acids and a cross-linking agent such as potassium. The biodegradability of previous hydrogel materials is slow, 10 to 15% per year with no sign of bioaccumulation. However, new research highlighted that superabsorbent polymer hydrogel may have negative effects on the plants and the environment. Although hydrogel such as polyacrylamide hydrogel is not hazardous, it contains 0.01-0.05% acrylamide substance of carcinogenic nature. Furthermore, superabsorbent hydrogels were found to decrease plant uptake of nutrients, premature release of nutrients, non-releasing nutrient when required by crops, high production cost, and generates large amounts of non-biodegradable waste and soil contamination. The concerns about using hydrogels in agriculture triggered the search for a more benign and environmentally friendly hydrogel material. This project suggests a novel hydrogel material, which is made up of 99% weight water, environmentally biodegradable, nontoxic and inexpensive materials. The new hydrogel is aluminium hydroxide polyhydrate gel that contains 1% aluminium hydroxide polyhydrate and 99% water. The hydrogel is considered to be safe as aluminium hydroxide is used in water purification, and it degrades into tiny fibers within a couple of weeks when it is dry; otherwise, it remains saturated in water solution. It should be noted that about 8% of the earth crust is aluminium, and this widely spread element has no known environmental impacts. Aluminium salts are also remarkably nontoxic and were classified as non-carcinogenic by the US department of health and human services. A thin layer of aluminium hydrogel, between 3 to 5 mm, will be set on a 3 cm compost layer and covered with ~1 cm layer of compost, to protect plant seeds laid on top of the hydrogel layer. Sandwiching aluminium hydrogel between compost soil layers was found efficient to keep the hydrogel moist by retaining the irrigation water added to the topsoil. Furthermore, experimental work showed that adding a hydrogel layer between compost helps to control water movement in soil and keeping it wet. Although a hydrogel layer of 3 to 5 mm was found enough for growing plants, additional work is still required to optimize the thickness of the required hydrogel layer and distance from the topsoil. Compost soil with aluminium hydroxide hydrogel will be used in greenhouse farms for vegetable and fruits plantation. Finally, the compost-hydrogel mixture can be recycled or partially mixed with fresh compost for reuse since the aluminium hydrogel is almost completely decomposed when dries.","The state of Qatar suffers from extreme drought and arid climate conditions that limits the agricultural activities in the country.

We developed a new therapy and show that it effectively suppresses inflammation in severe asthma and likely emphysema. It is a human protein and so is unlikely to have side effects. We now need to define how it works, optimise delivery to achieve maximum benefit, show efficacy in different forms of asthma, and COPD, and in human cells. This will enable us to perform clinical trials to show that it is effective in human patients.","There are no effective treatments for severe asthma or emphysema.
